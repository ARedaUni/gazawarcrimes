Incident,"5 Across our inves tigative research , we emp loy a suite of methodo l ogies in s patial and archi tec tural analy sis, op e n-source investigation , digital mo delling, and w itness interviewing using three-dime nsional digital mo dels (sp eci˚c methodologies applied in respect of this report are outlined in the methodology section below, and further, where necessary, in each chapter). We reconstruct incidents, including incidents of IHL and human right s violations, violations of the Genocide Convention, as well as conducting large-scale analysis of patterns of violations a cross larger terr itories and per iod s, by examining and analysing evidence obtained elsewhere."

Incident,"17 FA™s provi sion of thi s report to South Africa follows the report s it has previousl y provided to South Africa: (a) Inhum an e Zones: An asses sment of I srael™s actions with respect to the provis ion of aid, shelter, safe p assage, and assistance to evacuees in Gaza; respons e to questions rais ed in the ICJ on 17 May 2024 (pub. 19 May 2024) (b) A sp atial analysis of Israe l™s conduct in Rafah and across Gaza since the International C ourt of Justice Order for the Modi˚cation of Provisional Measures (submitted 5 September 24) 7 C˜ SCOPE 18 This report aims to pres ent p atterns of ‚incidents™ Œ that is, attacks or acts of destruction committed by the Israeli military Œ within the area of the occupie d Gaza Strip (hereafter ‚Gaza™) betwe en 7 October 2023 and 16 September 2024. The se incidents include att acks on home s, shelters, hospitals, and other medical facilities; public institutions such as universities, schools, and government buildings; places of c ultural signi˜canc e such as c emeterie s, archaeological sites, and mosques; agricultural infrastr ucture such as ˜elds, orchards, greenhouses, and water wells; and infrastructure for the transport, storage, and  distribution  of  aid."
Incident,"21 The repor t seeks to identif y ‚pattern s™ within the se act s of violenc e , by which we me an the order of repetition of same, similar or related incidents , at di˚erent times and places . Such pat terns m ay indicate that thes e attacks are designed, formally or informally, rather than occurring at random or in a haphazard way. Pattern analysis is derived from the colle ction and veri˜cation of individual incidents."
Incident,"Our databas e is made up of all incidents we have collected and veri˜ed (s ee veri˜cation framework below) bet ween 7 October 2023˛11 October 2024. While our datas et of incidents is limited by what we were able to verify within the timeframe provided, our analysis of this datas et demonstrates clear p atterns of speci˜c military conduct and practices repeated over time and through space; we outline these patterns as ˜ndings in each of the areas of study. FA uses its professional expertise to determine the presence of pat terns but does not m ake determinations beyond those patterns directly observable from the data, nor does it make legal inferences or legally evaluate its ˜ndings."
Incident,"23 The GCD all ow s us to s tu dy and prese nt patter ns related to all do cumented and ve ri˜ ed incid ents relate d to a single category of attack Œ for example, targeting of aid, destruction of me dical infrastructure, or environmental destruction Œ across the entire territory of Gaza  bet ween October 2023 and June 2024. Importantly, the GCD allows u s to study relations between incidents of m ore than one category."
Incident,This enables us to consider whether relations exist bet ween di˚erent t ypes of attack.
Incident,"12 27 We consider attacks on civilians to be any act of violence against the civilian population and civilian obje cts, whether in o˜ence or in defence, even if the attack does not lead to the death or injury of civilians."

Incident,"5˜ Destruction of Medical Infrastructure Œ including targeting of hospitals and other medical infrastructure, or otherwise forcing medical facilities out of operation, and the targeting of healthcare workers."
Incident,"6˜ Destruction of Civilian Infrastructure Œ including the targeting of schools, mosques, and government buildings."
Incident,7˜ Targeting of Aid Œ including the targeting and destruction of infrastructure and personnel necessary for the transport and distribution of humanitarian and food aid.
Incident,10 E˜ CONTEXT 30 Our p attern analysis extends beyond the establishment of relationships between contemporaneous incidents and s eeks als o to examine relationships to incidents across the region™s history.
Incident,"36 56 Th e system an d inf rastructure of the block ade were used to enact the pre sent siege of 2023˝2024 (s ee Chapter 7: Targeting of A id). This is made explicit in Prime Minister Netanyahu™s 18 October 2023 state ment: ‚we will not all ow humanitarian a ssistance in the form of foo d and medicines from our territory to the Gaza Strip.™ In mid-January 2024, after international pressure, Netanyahu returned to a policy of strictly regulated aid bas ed on Israel™s interpretation, nowhere internationally accepted, of what constitutes the humanitarian minimum in Gaza."
Incident,"Since the end of 2023, this dune area was designated by the Isra eli mili tar y as a ‚humani tarian zo ne™ fo r disp laced peo pl e, d es pite lacking alm os t any infras tru cture to sup p ort the numbe r of p eo ple dis placed there. Even after Is rael designated the area a s a ‚humanitarian zone™ it was continuously targeted from the air and invaded by the Israeli military on the ground (s ee Chapter 3: Displacement). Survival in this zone p artially relied on Palestinians reverting to the area™s traditional ways of obtaining water by digging wells following the traditional al-Mawasi system."
Incident,"75 This design aim ed to segregate the targeted pop ulation in a designated spa ce whose per im eter was controlled, sometimes fenced, or otherwise secured. Entry and exit into this space were also controlled. The treatment of p eople within these zones was markedly di˜erent from those in surrounding areas."
Incident,"We showe d that a recurrent element in genocide is displacement. To generate displacement, the perpetrators often de stroy the life-sustaining environment from which it seeks to displac e the targeted population. By destroying the means that sustain the biological, cultural, and political life of the targ eted populatio n , the pe rpetrato rs fo rced the targeted groups to leave. The d estruc tio n and transformation of the environment was often als o undertaken to prevent the return of survivors to the area from which they were originally driven out."
Incident,"80 Collection : We collect information from a variety of media formats that include recorded videos, photographs, satellite and remote-sens ing im agery, written and oral testimony, and text-based reports of incidents Œ from three t ypes of s ources: (a) Using open-source research methodologies (see OSI below) (b) Sent to us directly from individual s ources (s ee Credibilit y below) (c) Datas ets shared with us by trusted organisations in our ˚eld (s ee Credibilit y below) 81 Veri˚cation: In relation to (a) and (b), materials are veri˚ed according to the veri˚cation f ramework outlined below. In relation to (c), we examine the third party™s data-gathering methodology and sample th e dat aset to determin e that th e dat aset meets our st an dards. If we deem it n eces sary, we investigate the  ˚le  using  veri˚cation  s oft ware  (s ee  ‚veri˚cation  and  interpretation™)."
Incident,"82 Interp ret ation: Interpretation is the process of reading what the data pertaining to a p articular incident tells us. For text-bas ed materials, this means deriving the details of an incident, including its location, time, and context. Where necessary, our res earchers corroborate the claims of an incident with visual eviden c e found in footage or satellite imagery, which may capture the incident or its aftermath (see ‚veri˚cation and interpretation™). For visual mater ials, this involves c lose analysis of what is ‚in the frame™, and what is implied ‚outside the frame™ by the contents of the frame. This process varies depe nding on case c ontext. It c ould inc lud e ide ntifying the unifo rm s of sol dier s o r civil society pe rsonnel, id entifying the pres ence of emergency s ervices, or identifying any weapons or munitions (or munition fragments)."
Incident,"Through examining these and other features, our researchers piece together what can be understood of what has unfol d ed w i thin the incid ent c aptured by a piece of m edia. Co mm o nly, the p ro cess of interpretation al so involves cross-referen cing between th e subject dat a an d oth er data apparently pertaining to the same incident. This process ends by providing a written description of the incident, which is stored within our incident databas e and subs equently the GCD."
Incident,"8 3 Mapping : Once an incident is considered to have been veri˚ed, either as ‚con˚rmed™ or ‚most likely™, we enter that incident into our databas e, categorising and labelling it to include information such as sources , time of incident, location of incident. Each incident is given an identi˚cation number (‚ Incident ID™) compri sed of the abbreviate d date of the inc ident and a unique code (Y MMDD12345). These IDs are cited and footnoted where the relevant incident is mentioned in the report, s o that it can be directl y corroborated with information per taining to it in the database. All incident s that are referenc ed 25 in the body of the text are liste d in the appendix of the chapter in which they appear, along with their p rimary source info rmation. Additio nal source info rmatio n c an be found in the GCD. Incide nt data is also pull ed into the GCD™s c arto grap hic inte r fa ce, w he re i t c an be analysed in relatio n to othe r incidents in sp ace and time. Incidents which are mapped in ˚gures throughout the report are in the GCD along with their s ource materials."
Incident,"52 In the cas e of most of thes e X/ Twitter posts, the video or image its elf, in combination with other image data pertaining to the same incident, drawn from other posts, contains information su˜icient to determine the location of the airstrike as indeed within the al-Mawasi ‚humanitar ian zone™. Further, the ima ge, in combination with satellite ima gery from the days before and after, contains information su˜icient to determine that the airstrike indeed occurred on the day claimed Œ at the coordinates determined by the process of geolocation, there is no crater visible on 9 Septemb er 2024, but a crater is visible in imagery captured on 10 September 2024. The image, and other ass ociated image data, does not in its elf contain enough information to determine that 1 9 civilians died in the strike, a s wa s rep orted by Gaza™s health ministry."
Incident,"53 However, that 52 ˛ Incident ID: 40910-91667 53 ˛ Beth an McKe rn an, ‚Kh an Youn is Saf e Zone : Israel Launches Deadly S trike on al- Mawasi, Gaz a Of ficials Say™ The Guardian (10 Se pte mbe r 2024) <https: //www.theguardian.c om/worl d/articl e/2024/se p/10/kh an-younis-israel-s trike-al-mawasi-tent-camp-gaz a- deaths-humanitarian-s afe-zone> ac cessed 27 Se pte mbe r 2024."
Incident,"88 A second example: a video p osted online on 29 February 2024 claims to show the aftermath of an attack on a group of civilians waiting to receive aid from a truck at the al-Nabulsi roundabout, near the Netzarim corridor. The video contains information su˜icient to determine that the incident took place at the claime d location. The content of the original vide o i s not imme diatel y, full y, and straightforwardl y clear, and thus a process of careful interpretation of the video™s content begins. T hat process of interpretation may involve cross-referencing the content of this video with other videos and images of the same incident from di˜erent angles Œ a process which requires that thos e videos are thems elves geo - and chronolocated and interpreted. (In this way, it is evident that veri˚cation and interpretation of multiple images and videos may occur simultaneously; image and video s ources may be mutually s upporting.) The original image and video may also b e cross-referenced with repor ts from news organisations, independent journalist s, and NGOs, until such time Œ as in this example Œ that to th e best of our res earchers™ understanding, the incident can be fairl y described as claimed: as an attack on  civilians  waiting  for  aid  distribution."
Incident,"89 As the examples ab ove demon strate, veri˚cation i s a process which responds to, and is determined by, the available  evidentiary  material,  and by  the question s  that  are aske d  of  that  material, and  the obje ctive of the process: what about the material is a res earcher s eeking to verify? The process of veri˚cation is not (or not only) a set of yes/no questions; the processes of ver i˚cation and interpretation often overlap. Further, in s ome cas es, we have found that while the incident transpired almost as described in the ass ociated claim, the claim in s ome respects varied from or exceeded what can be known by the contents of the image/video material, and any ass ociated and credible reports."
Incident,"90 In this c a se c ontext , the result of the p rocess of ve ri˚c atio n and inter p retatio n is that an incid ent is clas si˚ed as con˚rmed , most likely , or unkn own (see below). That classi ˚cation is the result of th e processes describ e d ab ove, or of an inc ident having b e en reporte d by a credible s ource (se e Cre dibility below). Three categories of classi˚cation are de˚ned as follows: (A) Con˚rmed 9 1 In our professional ass essment, this incident occurred as described by the ass ociated claim."
Incident,"92 A n incident is classi˚ed as ‚con˚rmed™ if : (a) the re is image/vid eo mate r ial d o cumenting the incid e nt w hich has been g eo l oc ated and chronolocated, and the content of the material corresponds to the ass ociated claim OR (b) there is image/video material documenting the incident which has not been geolocated and/ or chronolocated, but at least one credible s ource has reported on the same incident OR (c) there is no image/video m aterial capturing the in cident, but it has been reported by a credible  source 27 (B) Most likely 93 In o ur professional assessment, this incident is most likely to have occurred as described by the associated claim."
Incident,"94 A n incident is classi˚ed as ‚most likely™ if : (a) there i s image/vide o material documenting the incident which has not b een ge olocate d and/or chronolocated OR (b) it has not been reported by a credible  source (s ee  de˚nition  below) BUT (c) there is visual evidence pertaining to the potential incident via satellite imagery (C) Unknown 95 In o ur profess ional assessment, insu ˜icient im age/video m aterial or insu ˜ icient credible so urces exist to con˚rm with any con˚dence a given claim."
Incident,"96 A potential incident is classi˚ed as ‚unknown™ if : (a) there is no image/video material documenting the incident AND (b) there are no reports by a credible  source AND (c) the potential incident or its aftermath is not visible in satellite imagery (D) Credibility 97 A process of ‚source analysis™ is used to establish whether an online source shoul d be considered credible, drawing on best practice guidelines for the ˚eld, including the B erkeley Protocol on Digital Open- Source Investigations (the ‚B erkeley Protocol™), and in line with established practices of other agencies in our ˚eld (including B ellingcat, Mnemonic, the Global Legal Action Net work, and A irwars, among  others)."
Incident,"101 As de scribed above, each recorded incident is collected, veri˚ed, geolocated, timed, and tagged."
Incident,"This allows for a high multiplicity of incidents to be cross-referenced and studied in relation to eac h other. Our res earchers us e the GCD to move across di˜erent levels of analysis and identify relations betwee n incidents , patterns , and rep eti tions of ac ts of v iol ence across the entire te rri tor y of Gaza and throughout the duration of the con˘ict. The GCD is conceived as both a tool of res earch and as a tool of presentation ,  allowing  the  extraction and  pres entation  of  multiple  evidentiary  threads ."
Incident,"102 The GCD is a car tographic doc umentation of actions conducted by the Israel Defenc e Forc e s (henc efor th ‚the Israe li military™ or ‚the military™) in Gaza since October 2023, including aerial bombardment, shootings, artillery strikes, bulldozing, and demolition, organis ed as discrete ‚incidents™, but arranged in s uch a way that pattern s and relation ships b etween inc idents may b e di scerne d. Within the interface of the GCD, us ers can delineate a geographic region, a time period, or both, and retrieve information about all incidents we colle cted within that delineated domain. In this way, the GCD provides res earchers with the raw data with which to anal yse relation s and potential pattern s b etwe en inc idents. All inc idents are recorded in local time (Gaza), and place names are translated into English."
Incident,56 107 All incidents analysed and mapped can b e found in the GC D online.
Incident,Source s for factual averment s within this report which are not part of our incident databas e (GCD) follow the following criteria: text repor t s about event s follow the veri˚cation framework™s credibility criteria; the use of open-sourc e footage  follows  the veri˚cation  framework™s  standards  for  authenticit y  and  geolocation;  all  statistics come from reputable and established organizations and experts.
Incident,"3.2 Geolocation 1 10 Geolocation is the technique by which researchers can determine the precise place at which an incident occurs. A de˚nition is provided in the Berkeley Protocol on Digital Op en Source Investigations: 111 ‚Geolocation  is  the  identi˚cation  or  estimation  of  the  location of  an  object,  an  activit y or  the  location from which an ite m was generated. Fo r example, it may be possible to deter mine the location from which a video or photograph downloaded from the Internet was taken using geolocation techniques."
Incident,"33 can be overlaid on contemporary satellite imagery to view chan ge s over time for a given region, for example, to study a neighbourhood undergoing prolonged aerial attacks , or the degradation of vegetation in a ˚eld."
Incident,(b) The checkpoints exclusively allow for one-way movement by civilians from the north to the s outh (s ee Chapter 3: Displacement) and aid from ‚s outh™ to ‚north™ (s ee Chapter 7: Targeting of  A id).
Incident,"58 2.8 The territorial arrangement imposed on Gaza through the abovementioned elements is key to understanding other dimensions of Israel™s military campaign, such as the destruction of agriculture, the displacement of civilians, and the targeting of aid in par ticular areas (see Chapter 58 ˛ ‚Israeli Minis te rs Join Ultran ation alis t Confe re nce Urging Gaz a Resettl e me nt,™ Reuters (29 January 20 24) <https: //www.reu te rs.c om/ worl d/middl e-eas t/israeli-minis te rs-join-ultran ation alis t-c onfe re nce-urging-gaz a-resettl e me nt-2024-01-29/> ac cessed 26 Septe mber 20 24.; See also App e ndix: S tudy o f the relationsh ip betwee n Israeli public s tate me nts and Israeli mi litary c onduc t in the o c cupied Gaz a s trip."

Incident,"(e) According to data publi shed by the UN, 346 schools were use d as shelters, 70% of them were attacked."
Incident,38 2˜ Pat tern ˚n dings 2.1 The Israeli military has continuously attacked all areas of Gaza such that no place can reasonably be considered safe.
Incident,"1 17 The Israeli military has attacked: (a) Destination  areas,  including  the  ‚humanitarian  zone™ (b) Israeli  designa ted ‚safe  r outes™ (c) Unde˚ned areas, including civilian shelters (d ) Civilians from within evacuation areas 2.2 Destination areas have decreased in size, even as the displaced population has increased."
Incident,2.3 The Israeli military™s use of evacuation orders has put civilians at risk by: (a) Issuing  inconsistent  and  incomplete  information  about  the  ‚humanitarian  zone™ (b) Issuing unclear and inconsistent evacuation orders (c) Instructing civilians to evacuate to areas that were attacked s oon after (d ) Issuing evacuation o rde rs af te r hav ing alrea dy begun mili tary operations within the area in question (e) Issuing a s equence of evacuation orders that displaced civilians multiple times (f) Instructing civilians to displace to areas that had recently received evacuation orders (g) Failing to specify the duration or expiry of evacuation orders (h) Displacing civilians to destination areas that were previously targeted and destroyed 2.4 The Israeli military besieged displaced civilians and funnelled them into checkpoints where they were surveilled.
Incident,61 (b) 31 of 36 hospitals have been targeted by Israeli military attacks.
Incident,"(g) 1 hospital (Patient™s Friends Societ y Hospital) has been attacked and forced out of s ervice t wice, having rebuilt and reestablished operations."
Incident,"60 ˛ Many hospitals and fiel d hospitals h ave bee n attacked multip l e times and in dif f e re nt f orm s, and as such are ac c ounted f or in multip l e categories of the quantitative findings."
Incident,41 2˜ Pat tern ˚n dings 2.1 The Israeli military repeatedly targeted medical infrastructure across Gaza.
Incident,"(A) The Israeli military™s targeting of hospitals follows a consistent and discernible pattern of ˛ve t ypically consecutive phases: (a) Evacuation orders and warnings (27 hospitals) (b) Attacking the surroundings of hospitals (2 9 hospitals) (c) Direct attacks on hospitals (31 hospitals) (d ) Putting hospitals under siege (11 hospitals) (e) Invading hospitals (10 hospitals) (B) The Israeli military™s attacking of hospitals correlates with the advancement and presence of Israeli ground forces: (a) Th e ˚rst hospitals in Gaza forc ed out of service by Israeli att ack s were in areas into which the ground invasion ˚rst advanced (b) The position of the Israeli ground forces correlates with where hospitals were subs equently forced out of s ervice (c) Whe n large hos pi tals we re atta cked by Israeli ground fo rces, small hos pi tals in the sur rounding area were often als o attacked and forced out of s ervice (C) Sites of medical infrastructure where healthcare services were (a) reestablished and (b) introduced were subsequently targeted by the Israeli military: (a) Hospitals where healthcare services reem erged endured subsequent atta cks by the Israeli  military (b) Field hospitals introduced to support Gaza™s healthcare system were clos ed due to Israeli military  conduct 2.2 The timing of the Israeli military™s attacks on hospitals correlates with the presence of displaced civilians at those hospitals 2.3 The Israeli military targeted medical personnel and facilities in a manner which causes damage to Gaza™s medical system (A) Healthcare workers have been direct targets of the Israeli military, as opposed to being indirect casualties of attacks on hospitals."
Incident,(C) The Israeli military™s targeting of hospitals caused damage to Gaza™s maternity services.
Incident,1 21 Of 353 shelters in Gaza: (a) 71% were atta cked; 219 were dama ged and 31 were destroyed (see Chapter 7: Targeting of Aid).
Incident,"1 22 Of 60 5 utilities (power plants, water wells, desalination plants, and fuel stations) in Gaza: (a) 53% were attacked; 166 were damaged and 152 were destroyed, rendering them inoperable."
Incident,1 23 Of 564 education facilities Œ schools in Gaza: (a) 75% were attacked; 334 were damaged and 91 were destroyed.
Incident,1 24 Of  44  education  facilities  Œ  universities in  Gaza: (a) 8 1% were attacked; 18 were damaged and 18 were destroyed.
Incident,1 25 Of 45 government buildings in Gaza: (a) 82% were attacked; 17 were damaged and 20 were destroyed.

Incident,2˜ Pat tern ˚n dings 131 Pattern ˚ndings of the attacks on civilian infrastructure are divided into t wo p arts: (a) an analysis of the ˚rst three weeks of the aerial bombing camp aign in Gaza.
Incident,(B) Israel™s attacks south of Wadi Gaza increased after it ordered civilians from the nor th to evacuate to the south.
Incident,(B) Areas in proximit y to critical infrastructure were targeted: (a) We observed repeated damage to service roads imm ediately surrounding cr itical infrastructure.
Incident,45 Chapter 7 ˜ Targeting of A id 1˜ Quantitative ˜n dings 1.1 We documented 322 incidents of aid-targeting between 7 October 2023 and 16 September 2024.
Incident,"Of which: (a) 17 attacks were on bakeries (b) 73 attacks were on shelters for displaced Palestinians, such as UNRWA-run schools, where food aid was received and distributed (c) 60 attacks were on aid pers onnel (d ) 50 attacks were on civilians seeking aid Œ 37 of these occur red just north of the Netzarim corridor between January and March 2024. (More civilians were killed in attac ks which we have classi˜ed as attacks on other targets.) (e) 78 attacks were on aid infrastructure, such as warehous es and water treatment facilities (f) 22 attacks were on convoys of trucks transp orting aid through Gaza, which were coordinated by  humanitarian  aid  organisations (g) 6 attacks were on aid convoys en route to Gaza through Israel or the occupied West Bank, carried  out  by  Israeli  vigilantes  during  May  2024 (h) 16 attacks were on markets where aid was being obtained by civilians (i) At least 17 of the attacks on aid pers onnel, convoys, and infrastructure targeted sites involved in operations that had been o˚icially coordinated with Israe l and recognis ed as ‚decon˛icted sites™, understood to be exempt from Israeli military targeting, or ‚safe™."
Incident,"1.2 We documented the following attacks on aid sites and systems operated by UNRWA: (a) Among the attacks on aid p ersonnel, convoys , and infra structure, at lea st 39 were on UNRWA personnel, facilities, or vehicles."
Incident,"46 2˜ Pat tern ˚n dings 2.1 Our analysis indicates that the Israeli military targeted sites and systems of aid distribution when and where they became the main mode of aid facilitation. We observed that this targeting followed a pattern of overlapping phases, during which attacks on the speci˛ed aid categories intensi˛ed: (a) Octob erŒNovemb er 2023: Bakeries in the north of Gaza were targeted when they played a critical  role  in  aid distribution, during October and early Novemb er 2023."
Incident,"(b) Octob er 2023˛Januar y 2024: She lters were targeted when they assume d a central role in housing people displaced by Israeli attacks, and facilitating the receipt and preparation of food aid, f rom 13 Octob er to Decemb er 2023."
Incident,"(c) December 2023˛February 2024: Pales tinian police o˝icers , who we cate gorise as ai d personnel , were targeted when they played a critical role in escorting aid convoys."
Incident,(d ) Januar yŒMarch 2024: Civilian s were targeted when gathering to receive aid from aid trucks that p ass ed through the Netzarim corridor checkpoints into northern Gaza f rom Januar y to March 2024.
Incident,"(f) October 2023, De cember 2023, and May 2024: Aid distribution and stor age sites , in clud ing warehouse s and market s, were targeted when they were acti vely operating to supply ci vilians with food, with severe at tacks on Rafah crossing, Karem Abu S alem/Kerem Shalom crossing, and markets during periods of increased aid- entering."
Incident,(g) May 2024: Israeli vigilantes attacked aid convoys p assing through Israel and the occupied West Bank under the watch and sometimes with direct support of Israeli military pers onnel.
Incident,"2.2 The periods after which Israel increased the ˝ow of humanitarian aid into Gaza (late December 2023; late March and early April 2024; early May 2024) coincide in time and space with an increase of Israel™s targeting of the means of distributing that aid, including the logistics, personnel, and infrastructure necessary."
Incident,2.3 The targeting of aid occurred in tandem with the Israeli military™s evacuation orders and coincides with its attempts to force Palestinian civilians to displace from the nor th of Gaza. The construction of the new internal border in the Netzarim corridor and the checkpoints within it supporting a one-way (north to south) movement of civilians coincided with the restriction of aid as a means of displacement.
Incident,(b) The checkpoints exclusively allow for one-way movement by civilians from the north to the s outh (s ee Chapter 3: Displacement) and aid from ‚s outh™ to ‚north™ (s ee Chapter 7: Targeting of  A id).
Incident,"50 2.8 The territorial arrangement imposed on Gaza through the abovementioned elements is key to understanding other dimensions of Israel™s military campaign, such as the destruction of agriculture, the displacement of civilians, and the targeting of aid in par ticular areas (see Chapter 3: Displacement, Chapter 6: Destruction of Civilian Infrastructure, Chapter 4: Destruction of Agriculture and Water Resources, and Chapter 7: Targeting of Aid)."
Incident,Further chapters will pres ent how thes e attacks have been conducted in relation to the imposition of this sp atial system.
Incident,"C˜ SCOPE 5 In this chapter, we examine how the territory of Gaza has been reshaped by acts of destruction and construction bet ween 7 October 2023 and 30 June 2024. It lays the ground for subs equent chapters by pres enting the sp atial system within which the incidents they describe take place."

Incident,"1 26 In a testimony shared with Forensic Architecture by Al Mez an, T., a farmer from Khan Younis (Abasan al-K abira) states : 19 ‚I am 84 years old, and I have been working in agriculture since 1980. I am married and support my family, my children and their children. I have 20 dunums of land in the cit y of A basan al-K abira, east of Khan Younis, on the lands of Wadi Saber. I grow vegetables, olives and s ome trees on my land, which is my main profession through which I support my family. However, with the start of the aggression, I was unable to cultivate my crops becaus e we were displaced from one place to another. I began to be displaced after the Israeli occup ation entered Khan Younis. [....] One year ago, before the pres ent aggression, we were harvesting olive trees, but even then, we could not complete the harvest becaus e of the occup ation and our inabilit y to reach our lands due to its proximit y to the [eastern] ﬁborderﬂ area [with Israel]. Now we cannot reach our lands despite our return to [the area] becaus e it has been subjected to shelling and targeting, alongside its neighbouring lands. Our land was subjected to direct strikes and random shelling, which destroyed all the vegetables and olive trees that were planted, as well as the destruction of the water lines leading to it and the destruction of the infrastructure. Agriculture is my prim ary profession, and we n ow depend directly on aid and assistance. I have not been able to harvest any crops since the aggression and the occup ation™s entry into Khan Younis. We are now unable to provide for ours elves due to the high cost of living, our need for medical treatment, for me and my wife, and our need for healthy food due to our old age.™ 1 27 In a testimony share d with Forensic Archite cture by Al Mezan, A. , a far mer from Rafah states: 20 ‚My agricultural lands, which are 9 dunams in addition to 5 greenhous es, is located in the [Mawarij] area of Rafah, an area currently controlled by the Israeli military. At the beginning of the war and until February [2024], I could onl y reach my land with great di˜iculty and fear, but we managed to plant cu cumber s, eggp lants and pe ppe rs o n it , and I u sed to take care of irr igating the cro ps daily and providing agricultural supplies, as their prices rose greatly, pesticides and seeds. Even obtaining water was expen sive becaus e we needed dies el to operate the water motor at times. The land and its crops were our only s ource of livelihood. But with the continuously intensi˚ed situation, it became di˜icult to reach our crops, and with the invasion of the cit y of Rafah in May 2024, reaching our lands became impossible. The latest we know about our land from s ome published photos is the destruction of 34 s olar p anels, the complete destruction of 5 greenhous es, and the bulldozing of most of the crops.

Incident,"100 Our analysis suggests that targeting thes e hospitals s erved as a tool for displacing Palestinians and facilitated the ground invasion into Gaza. This is evident from Figure 5.29 showing the Israeli military ground invasion on 1 November an d th e areas it would ad van ce into, areas over an d n ear the three hospitals that were ˚rst forced out of s ervice."
Incident,"101 As the Israeli military invaded north Gaza, it sim ultaneously entered through the Netzarim corridor, where the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital is located. On 30 October 2023, while the ground invasion forces were stationed along Salah-al-Din Road approximately 2.3 km away from the hospital, the facilit y was targeted by an Israeli airstrike (s ee Figure 5.28 ). [Incident ID: 3103094975] 389 102 Following this incident, the hospital (the only specialis ed cancer hospital in Gaza) was forced out of s ervice on 1 November 2023 and evacuated."

[Incident ID: 40 51249194] 105 By examining the locations of hospitals that were forced to clos e and evacuate, alongside the ground invasion and occup ation of the Netzarim corridor, our analysis suggests that, like the three hospitals in the north, the targeting of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital was due to it being in an area where the ground invasion would advance (see Figure 5.30 )."

Incident,"1 10 The siege and invasion of the s even hospitals mentioned above correlates with the position of Israeli gro und forces (see Figure 5.31 ). For example, as th e ground invas ion advanced to al-Quds Hosp ital on 12 November 2023 (s ee Figure 5.32 ), the hospital was evacuated becaus e of direct attacking by the Israeli military.

Incident,"415 1 27 The Israeli militar y targe ted medical inf rastr ucture across Gaza Œ conclusion 1 28 This analysi s reveals a long-term p attern of targeting hospitals across Gaza. The attacks exhibit three key characteristics: 1) repetition, evidenced by the number of hospitals targeted by the Israeli military, 2) c onsis te ncy, s how n throu gh the sus tained number of attacks o n mul tipl e hospi tals in di˜e re nt locations over an extended time perio d, 3) form, demonstrated by the ˚ve -phase pattern we observed in the targeting of hospitals."

Incident,"Figure 5.47 , Figure  5.48 , and Figure  5.49 show the distribution of thes e ˚gures over time. The timelines demonstrate that attacks on e ach of these ho spitals were mo st f requent at the height of the displac ed ci vilian population sheltering there. By cross-referencing the highest recorded number of displaced civilians sheltering at each hosp ital with the total number of at tacks each hosp ital faced, we observed that the greater the number of displaced civilians at a given hospital, the greater the number of attacks by the Israeli military on that hospital."

From this analysis we have obs erved: (a) Maternity wards and sp ecialist maternity hospitals have been directly attacked by the Israeli  military."
Incident,"171 Our data shows that the Israeli military has repeatedly targeted m aternity wards and specialist m aternity hospitals. Thes e attacks, alongside the existing strain on hospitals due to the sharp inc rease of patients since the Israeli military campaign began, have cau sed long-term damage to Gaza™s maternity services. We anal yse d the attacks on maternity s ervices by organising the numb er of attacks on hospitals according to the services they provide. We also anal yse d the details of each attack on hospitals with maternit y wards to ass ess whether there was evidence of a p attern of directly targeting maternit y s ervices."

[Incident ID: 4052999892] 433 (C) Damage to maternit y services in Gaza 172 T he at tacks on maternity wards , specialist maternity hospitals as well as hospitals with maternity wards ha s caused severe dis ruptio n to the provision of these se rv ices. Al ongsid e these direct attacks, hospitals have repeatedly reported needing to shut down their maternity departments due to the immense pre ssure on their emergency department s cause d by a large s urge of c i vilian patients wounded in the Israeli military camp aign. For instance, by 13 October, Nass er Medical C omplex had declared it had run out of beds and was operating at double cap acit y."
Incident,"100 173 The provision of maternit y s ervices has been further disrupted by the restriction of aid (s ee Chapter 7: Targeting of A id). The restriction of aid entering Gaza and reaching hospitals (s ee Section: Putting hospitals under s iege) has meant a shortage of necessary medical materials , medicine, and equipment, including diagnostic testing, sterile supplies, and hand soap, a s well a s ba sic necessities such a s fuel for power generators."
Incident,"105 As of mid-November 2023, Dr A bu Hatab said, ‚More than 50,000 pregnant women in the Gaza Strip lack primary care  and  childbirth  s ervices.™ 178 This issue is further exacerbated as p atients must be transferred from hospitals under attack, placing ad ditional strain o n Gaz a™s medical infra struc ture. This wa s evid ent in Nove mbe r 2023 w hen hospitals in n orthern Gaza were targeted by the I sraeli milit ary, n ec es sit ating th e transfer of patients to south ern hospitals. Over three cons ecutive days, from 24 November 2023, Nass er Medical C omplex received p atients from the Indonesian Hospital [Incident ID: 31124985 72], al- Shifa Me dical C omplex [Incident ID: 3112592222], and K amal Adwan Hospital. [Incident ID: 3112603500] 179 The eliminatio n of these se r v ices fo rced mate r ni ty patie nts to be transfe r red to othe r hos pi tals that could accommodate them.

Incident,"435 18 3 The Israeli militar y t argeted medical personnel and f ac ilities in a manner which causes damage to Gaza™s medical system Œ conclusion 184 This analysis reveals a p attern of attacks on healthcare workers, facilities, and s ervices that suggests a deliberate attempt to caus e damage to Gaza™s medical system with possible long-term e˜ects. The attacks are clustered aro und several strands of healthcare in Gaza: 1) healthcare workers, who have been targeted during the phas es of destruction of hospitals and outside of hospitals, 2) maternit y s ervices, which have been directly targeted by the Israeli military, both maternit y hospitals and dep artments, 3) the occup ation and destruction of hospitals after the depopulation of displaced civilians, the injured, and healthcare workers."
Incident,"185 The attacks on healthcare across several elements of its infrastructure, across multiple incidents, demonstrates a widespread p attern of destruction to Gaza™s healthcare system. The combination and re p etitio n of these for ms of attack by the Is raeli military su gg ests the targeting of medic al infra s tru cture is not accidental. The attacks target both the physical and s ocial elements of healthcare, suggesting an e˜ort to destroy medical infrastructure in Gaza. The targeting of healthcare workers, s ervices, and facilities across Gaza pos es long-term imp acts through the elimination of a skilled workforce, access to healthcare, and the physical infrastructure that provides healthcare."
Incident,"436 K˜ APPENDIX ˚ DESTRUCTION OF MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE 1˜ Testimony on the targeting of hospitals 186 Below is the testimony of MB, a m an who was arrested on 18 March at al-Shifa Medical Complex, where he had been for t wo months with his injured wife.

Incident,"198 There is also a specialized hosp ital, which the Israeli occupation deliberately targeted, the Kuwaiti Specialt y Hospital or Shifa Palestine, which has surgery rooms and X-rays, but no inp atient beds for extended stays, only for day surgeries. It operates as a ‚polyclinic™ or a ˚eld hospital."
Incident,"202 D octor: Fie ld hospitals are always under bombardment. The Red Cross ˚e ld hospital and the IMC h ospital wh en it was in Rafah always had the ir surroun din gs t argeted. Even dron es ˚red at th ese hospitals. The Red Cross hospital often had bombings and drone strikes around it, and mass casualt y incidents would overwhe lm the hospital™s capa city. Additionally, there™s been bombing near governm ent hospitals and even within government hospitals, such as Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital. Bombings in the camps als o damage all the tents and medical clinics there. The Israeli occupation shows no respect for medical teams, hospitals , or medical centres, even ˚eld hospitals . T here is no sanctity for these hospitals, and we need guarantees for the safet y of operations within them, whether government hospitals, ˚eld hospitals, or medical points."

Geolocation accuracy is categorised as exact, approximate, neighbourhood, town/cit y, or Gaza level."
Incident,"4 In ad di tio n to civilian c a su al ties, we have expanded our analysis to inc lude attacks on infrastructure and what the Isra eli military c lassi˚es as  ‚power  tar ge ts™."
Incident,"5 These include high-rise buildings, residential towers, and public institutions such a s universities, banks , and government o˜ices . According to the Israeli military sp okesp erson on 11 October, during the ˚rst ˚ve days of ˚ghting, approximately half of the targets bombed Œ 1,32 9 out of a total of 2,687 Œ were classi˚ed as ‚power targets™."
Incident,"3 4 To ˚ll in gaps and validate vis ual reporting where it is incomplete or unavailable , we use satellite imagery from Planet and UNOSAT damage analysis . The integration of satellite data has been instrumental in con˚rming and geolocating incidents that A irwars has documented but was unable to geolocate."
Incident,"As a result, our databas e currently contains 998 incidents between 7 October and 28 October 2023, with 244 incidents geolocated to exact location accuracy, 264 inc idents to approximate location ac curacy, 209 incidents to neighbourho od accuracy, and 269 incidents to town/city ac curacy and 12 incidents to Gaza accuracy."
Incident,"518 3˜ An alysis of street network dam age 3.1 Local accessibilit y analysis 45 We use the inc ident database and the UNOSAT damage layer to asse ss the impact of craters and debris on road accessibility near critical infrastructure. Critic al sites such a s hospitals or shelters were identi˚ed, and road networks adjacent to these locations were evaluated for damage that impeded vehicle access. Using satellite imagery, we identi˚ed repeated incidents where streets were cut o˜, blocking critical infrastructure such as ambulances and other vehicles."

Additionally, repeat damage to al-Israa Univers ity, University of Palestine, and al-Uma Univers ity in January 2024, March 2024, and April 2024 respectively, suggests that universit y buildings were targeted. Destruction of this kind was repeated after buildings were rendered unusable, and to the point of total collaps e."
Incident,530 1.2 Israel™s attacks south of Wadi Gaza increased after it ordered civilians from the north to evacuate to the south.
Incident,"71 Our analysis of the sp atial distribution of Israeli airstrikes over time suggests a p attern by which Israel increasingly attacked areas after it instructed civilians to evacuate to them . After the 13 October evacuation order instructing civilians to move from the north to the south of Wadi Gaza, the average of airstrikes in the south increased."
Incident,11 This resulted in an overall increas e in civilian deaths in comp aris on to the average number of civilians killed per day before 13 October. A mong thos e killed in the s outh after the 13 October evacuation order included families who had followed the evacuation orders and evacuated to the southern areas [ Incident ID: 3101447375] .

Incident,"72 The following section details the destruction of s ites of public infrastructure after those s ites had been previo usly dam aged. This pattern of recurrent attack to speci ˚c buildin gs suggests that th ey were singled out by military strikes , and that consequently destruction of such infrastructure was more likely to be deliberate than random."
Incident,"Eac h key site was observed through initial and subsequent damage, in order to ascertain the c hronology of attacks and obs erve how thes e attacks might constitute a p attern."
Incident,This correlation between proximity to milit ary movement and increase d infrastructural vulnerability suggests that infrastructure near these routes was more likely to be targeted.
Incident,"75 Through this analysis, we show how the destruction of civilian infrastructure appears to be p art of a broader  military  strate gy,  rather  than  a  s eries  of  is olated  incidents."
Incident,"76 The cas e studies below are organis ed as follows: (a) Repeat damage to the Rafah crossing (9 ˝17 October 2023; 5 MayŒ19 June 2024) (b) Repeat damage to buildings in A l Zahra area: Palace of Justice, al-Israa Universit y, Universit y of Palestine, and al-Uma Universit y (20 NovemberŒ24 June) (c) Repeat damage to the Universit y C ollege of A pplied Sciences (24 MayŒ12 August 2024) (d ) Repeat damage to al-Huda Mos que (12 FebruaryŒ2 September 2024) (e) Repeat damage al- Saqqa Mos que (14 NovemberŒ4 A pril 2024) (f) Repeat damage to the Rafah municip alit y building (15 JulyŒ22 August 2024) 533 (A) Rafah crossing (9 OctoberŒ17 October 2023; 5 MayŒ19 June 2024) 77 This analysis shows the repeated disruption of the Rafah crossing by the Israeli military (and limiting the entrance of aid).

Incident,"715 71 6 717 718 71 9 7. Targeting of Aid 1 In this chapter, we analys e incidents, and p attern s of incidents, in which the Israeli military obstructed or attacke d sites and systems for the provi sion and re ceipt of humanitarian aid, aid personnel, and civilians seeking aid."
Incident,"1 3 Escalated attacks: We use the term ‚escalated attacks™ to refer to a signi ˚cant increase in the rate of attacks obse rved fo r a give n aid categ or y. This is d eter mined by cross-referencing the tim e and location of all re corded incidents with one another, along with contextual research ab out a given period."
Incident,"4 Vigilante: We us e the term ‚vigilante™ in this chapter to refer to Israeli civilians who have acted, without o˜icial state instruction, to attack or disrupt aid routes and aid convoys destined for Gaza."
Incident,5 Decon˙icted : A site whose operation s and coordinates have b e en coordinate d with the Israeli authorities to protect and exempt it from military targeting.
Incident,72 1 B˜ SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 7 Our analysis of incidents in which aid was attacked indicates that the Israeli military repeatedly targeted aid across Gaza since the Israeli military campaign began in October 2023. The repeated nature of such attac ks suggests that they were not random.
Incident,1˜ Quantitative ˜n dings 1.1 We documented 322 incidents of aid-targeting between 7 October 2023 and 16 September 2024.
Incident,"Of which: (a) 17 attacks were on bakeries (b) 73 attacks were on shelters for displaced Palestinians, such as UNRWA-run schools, where food aid was received and distributed (c) 60 attacks were on aid pers onnel (d ) 50 attacks were on civilians seeking aid Œ 37 of these occur red just north of the Netzarim corridor between January and March 2024. (More civilians were killed in attac ks which we have classi˜ed as attacks on other targets.) (e) 78 attacks were on aid infrastructure, such as warehous es and water treatment facilities (f) 22 attacks were on convoys of trucks transp orting aid through Gaza, which were coordinated by  humanitarian  aid  organisations (g) 6 attacks were on aid convoys en route to Gaza through Israel or the occupied West Bank, carried  out  by  Israeli  vigilantes  during  May  2024 (h) 16 attacks were on markets where aid was being obtained by civilians (i) At least 17 of the attacks on aid pers onnel, convoys, and infrastructure targeted sites involved in operations that had been o˚icially coordinated with Israe l and recognis ed as ‚decon˛icted sites™, understood to be exempt from Israeli military targeting, or ‚safe™."
Incident,"1.2 We documented the following attacks on aid sites and systems operated by UNRWA: (a) Among the attacks on aid p ersonnel, convoys , and infra structure, at lea st 39 were on UNRWA personnel, facilities, or vehicles."
Incident,"722 2˜ Pat tern ˚n dings 2.1 Our analysis indicates that the Israeli military targeted sites and systems of aid distribution when and where they became the main mode of aid facilitation. We observed that this targeting followed a pattern of overlapping phases, during which attacks on the speci˛ed aid categories intensi˛ed: (a) Octob erŒNovemb er 2023: Bakeries in the north of Gaza were targeted when they played a critical  role  in  aid distribution, during October and early Novemb er 2023."
Incident,"(b) Octob er 2023˛Januar y 2024: She lters were targeted when they assume d a central role in housing people displaced by Israeli attacks, and facilitating the receipt and preparation of food aid, f rom 13 Octob er to Decemb er 2023."
Incident,"(c) December 2023˛February 2024: Pales tinian police o˝icers , who we cate gorise as ai d personnel , were targeted when they played a critical role in escorting aid convoys."
Incident,(d ) Januar yŒMarch 2024: Civilian s were targeted when gathering to receive aid from aid trucks that p ass ed through the Netzarim corridor checkpoints into northern Gaza f rom Januar y to March 2024.
Incident,"(f) October 2023, De cember 2023, and May 2024: Aid distribution and stor age sites , in clud ing warehouse s and market s, were targeted when they were acti vely operating to supply ci vilians with food, with severe at tacks on Rafah crossing, Karem Abu S alem/Kerem Shalom crossing, and markets during periods of increased aid- entering."
Incident,(g) May 2024: Israeli vigilantes attacked aid convoys p assing through Israel and the occupied West Bank under the watch and sometimes with direct support of Israeli military pers onnel.
Incident,"2.2 The periods after which Israel increased the ˝ow of humanitarian aid into Gaza (late December 2023; late March and early April 2024; early May 2024) coincide in time and space with an increase of Israel™s targeting of the means of distributing that aid, including the logistics, personnel, and infrastructure necessary."
Incident,2.3 The targeting of aid occurred in tandem with the Israeli military™s evacuation orders and coincides with its attempts to force Palestinian civilians to displace from the nor th of Gaza. The construction of the new internal border in the Netzarim corridor and the checkpoints within it supporting a one-way (north to south) movement of civilians coincided with the restriction of aid as a means of displacement.
Incident,"Annotated timeline of attacks ta r geting ai d a nd the p ha ses in w hi ch they occur. Each r ow dis plays a catego ry of aid att acks (e.g., att acks on aid infrastr uct ure), and it highlights a signi˜cant period , which is explained by an accompanying annotat ion. Note t hat s ome categories of attacks Œ aid infr ast ructure and aid per s onnel Œ are repeated in two dist inct rows."
Incident,"13 While the 29 Feb ruary ‚Flour Massacre™ and the 1 April att ack on the World Central Kitchen convoy are the most widely reported attacks on aid, we have documented a total of 322 attacks by the Israeli military on aid sites and systems."
Incident,14 We have previously documented the attacks on aid in an online platform at www.gaza-aid-at tacks.
Incident,"12 ˝ On 14 May 20 24, we published do cume ntation o f at l eas t 80 attacks on aid across Gaz a betwee n January and March. Our an alysis included the f o ll owing categories: attacks on aid infras truc ture; attacks on aid p e rsonnel; attacks on civi lians see king aid; and attacks on aid c onvoys."
Incident,"726 D˜ SCOPE 15 In this chapter, we examine Israel™s attacks on and impediments to various s ites and systems of aid distribution in Gaza from October 2023 to September 2024. Our analysis of thes e attacks address es the  following: (a) The frequency of Israeli attacks on aid sites and systems in sp ace and time."
Incident,"(b) How thes e attacks correlate to signi˚cant changes in the availabilit y and coordination of aid, such as the opening of border crossings and the emergence of new aid systems or groups."
Incident,"(c) The relation bet ween attacks on aid sites and systems and the displacement of Palestinian civilians,  by  way  of  restricting  the  availabilit y  of  aid."
Incident,16 The analysis considers attacks on aid in the following categories: (a) Attacks on bakeries: A ll facilities actively prep aring baked goods at scale.
Incident,(b) Attacks on shelters: A ll facilities o˜icially designated as housing displaced people.
Incident,"(d ) Attacks on aid p ersonnel : Palestinian police, public o˜ icials, members of family tribal groups , c i vilian volunte ers, and Pale stinian and international aid workers who were known to b e invol ve d in or responsible for aid delivery and s ecurit y. Attacks on aid personnel occurred at sites of aid  delivery,  receipt,  transportation,  and  storage,  and  on  vehicles  or  places  of  residence."
Incident,"(e) Attacks on marke ts: A ll facilities where commercial vendors or volunteers were distributing food,  during  their  time  of  operation."
Incident,"(f) Attacks on ai d infras tructure: Warehouses, distribution facilities, and water infra structure (not bakeries, shelters, and markets, which are already accounted for in other categories)."
Incident,"(g) Vigilante att acks on ai d: Instances where Israeli civilians disrupted aid truck convoys or attacked aid truck drivers, namely in the West Bank or in Israel."
Incident,"17 A mong thes e categories of attacks, we als o consider which of them constitute: (a) Attacks o n U NRWA: UNRWA sta˜ and employees, warehouses, and missions involved in the  distribution  of  aid."
Incident,(b) Attacks on decon˙icted sites: Facilities whose coordinates have been directly supplied to Israeli authorities to exempt them from military targeting.
Incident,"A screenshot from o ur interactive platform documenting 322 Israeli at t acks on aid for Gaza from 7 October 2023 to 1 6 September 2024 on a map (top) and in a t imeline (bottom). Attacks are categoris ed by colour: red for attacks on civilians s eeking aid; yellow for attacks on aid convoys; purple for attacks on aid personnel; or ange for attac ks on aid infr ast ructure; brown for attacks on bakeries; blue for attacks on shelter s; green for atta cks on markets; white for attacks by vigilantes on aid convoys (which are not depicted on t he map since t hey did not occur wit hin t he terr itory of Ga za).

Incident,"728 E˜ TIMELINE 19 Our analysis identi˚es the following phas es in Israel™s attacks on aid sites and systems in Gaza: 1˜ First three Weeks of bombing: 7ˆ27 October 2023 20 Following 7 October, long queues of Palestinians were seen outside bakeries. Israeli bombing destroyed bakeries, primarily in the north of Gaza (e.g., Gaza Cit y), and on three documented occasions directly after images of queues circulated online (s ee Section H1: Attacks on bakeries)."
Incident,"21 Th e Rafah cro s sing was att acked in at least three strike s between 9 October an d 1 6 October, disrupting the entry of aid from Egypt (s ee Section  H 6:  Attacks on  aid  infrastructure and Chapter 6: Destruction of Civilian Infrastructure)."
Incident,"2˜ Groun d Invasion of nor th of Gaza: from 27 October 2023 22 The Israeli military continued to attack bakeries. By late October, an estimated 600,000 Palestinians were displac ed to sh elters, which by then had begun to function as place s for receiving and distributing aid."
Incident,13 Israeli military bombing attacked shelters primarily during this period of critical reliance on them (s ee Section H2: Attacks on shelters).
Incident,"3˜ Cease˚re: 24ˆ30 November 2023 23 By the start of the temporary ceas e˚re, all bakeries in northern Gaza went out of operation, multiple water facilities had been damaged by Israeli ˚re, including the only wate r des alinatio n plant (see S ection H6: Attacks on aid infrastructure)."
Incident,14 24 Attacks on shelters continued after the cease˚re.
Incident,"4˜ Groun d invasion of south Gaza: from 4 December 2023 25 On 17 December, following the start of the ground inva sion in the south of Gaza, the Israeli military submitted to international pressure and opened the Karem Abu Salem/Kerem S halom crossing Œ a transit point for trucks located near Rafah. In the following weeks, the Israeli military attacked various aid pe rso nnel invo lved in facilitating the e ntr y a nd dis tribu tio n of aid into Gaz a, incl u ding killing the director of the K arem A bu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing (se e Section H3: Attacks on aid pers onnel Œ police escorting aid convoys and Section H 6 Attacks on aid infrastructure)."

Incident,"15 6˜ ICJ Order for Additional Provisional Measures: 28 March 2024 31 Four days after the order, on 1 April, the Israeli military launched a fatal attack on a World Central Kitchen convoy. After international pressure in the wake of the attack compelled Israel to allow more aid in on 5 A pril, and 9 April subs equently saw the highest volume of aid enter since 7 October 2023, the Israeli military attacked four markets the following week (s ee Section H7: Attacks on markets)."
Incident,"7˜ Groun d invasion of Rafah: from 6 May 2024 32 On 6 May, the Israeli military invaded Rafah, destroying aid warehous es there and s eizing the Rafah border c rossing with Egypt. Subsequently, the number of aid truc ks entering Gaza fe ll to an all-time low since the total blockade in O ctober 2023. The trucks that entered mostly comprised trucks belonging to the private s ector.

Incident,"731 G˜ METHODOLOGY 35 Our res earch involves a t wo -p art analysis: (a) Collection and veri˚cation of visual evidence and reports, and analysis of incidents where aid  was  targeted."
Incident,"36 For (a) , we began collecting information about attacks on civilians s eeking aid and collating them in the GC D (see Chapter 1: Introduction), spe c ifying the availabilit y of vi sual evidence, me dia sources, approximate location (neighbourhood or region), and approximate time. We subsequently investigated each incident to identify its precis e geographic coordinates and time where possible. As a result, most incidents have a con˚rmed approximate location, while s ome are geolocated precis ely."
Incident,"37 Within our corpus of attacks, we include circumstances where the known presence of Israeli military personnel and infrastructure creates choke points for aid logistics where attacks on aid repeatedly and frequentl y occur. At thes e location s which are prone to repeate d attacks, attacks from other arme d Palestinian groups are possible, namely as di˜erent armed groups attempt to wrest control over aid systems. When the speci˚c assailant of an attack is disputed, but when it still occurs at a location of repeated attacks by the Israeli military, we include it in our datas et."
Incident,"38 We us e mapping and ge olocation te chniques (se e Methodology in Chapter 1: Introduction) to accuratel y locate incidents captured in visual evidence. This data is cons idered highly reliable as it allows for pre c ise identi˚cation and mapping of a˜e cte d areas, which i s critical for analysing pattern s in the attacks. We verify incidents using the incident veri˚cation criteria outlined in Chapter 1: Introduction."
Incident,"In this report, we do not identify the speci˚c t ypes of munitions us ed for each attack in question."
Incident,41 We comp ared the data from areas (a) and (b) to  identify  relationships  bet we en  attacks  on aid  and  the understood level of reliance on the various t ypes of aid sites and systems.
Incident,"42 W ith th e att acks collated into one database , we analysed spatial an d temporal patterns alon gside media and vis ual evidence, to identify any relationships bet ween events. This led us to conceptualis e attacks on aid according to discrete temporal phas es of attack where di˜erent types of aid sites and systems were targeted in turn or where suc h attac ks predominantly escalated (see the following subs ection). This identi˚cation of discrete temporal phas es, however, does not mean that the attacks in question only occur within a speci ˚c temporal phase; they occur elsewhere, b ut we have highlighted temporal periods where attacks of a certain nature are signi˚cant Œ namely because of other contextual information and factors that identify thes e periods as signi˚cant beyond the data its elf. A ls o, there are 732 s ome t ypes of attack on aid that do not ˚t neatly into temporal phas es becaus e they have occurred consistently since 7 October 2023. For example, attacks on UNRWA have occurred consistently (s ee Section H10: Attacks on UNWRA and decon˘icted sites)."
Incident,H˜ CHRONOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE TARGETING OF AID 43 The following s ection details the phas es we have obs erved of the Israeli military™s targeting of aid.

Rather, each of the phas es represents a p articular period during which an acute escalation of attacks on a speci˚c t ype of aid is documented."
Incident,"46 Our identi˚cation of the desc ribed phases appears through a chronological analysis, through which we set out the character and s cale of incidents within each pha se.

Incident,"738 60 We understand that shelters that re ceive d displaced civilians are likely to be points of distribution or prep aration of aid. Attacks on shelters that we documented involved the direct targeting of a shelter building. In the case of the al-Fakhoura school, for example, the bombing of the area around the shelter on 14 October, which reportedly killed 34 and injured more than 80, preceded the direct targeting of the building on 4 November [3110418492] and 18 November [3111876 530] Œ the latter attack killing a total of 50 people Œ following a p attern of persistent and intensifying attacks consistent with attacks on hospitals (s ee Chapter 5: Destruction of Medical Infrastructure)."

Incident,"749 8 3 In an interview con ducted by the Bisan Center, a Palestinian research gro up, one Palestinian ˚eld coordinator for aid convoys explaine d: ‚After the occup ation s earches the trucks, it orders us to p ass through al-Rashid Road or Salah al- Din Road without prior warning, and because the occupation destroys thes e streets every day, whether by bulldozers or by building sand mounds or by throwing missiles and large bombs in the middle of thes e streets, we can only cross a few metres at al-Nabulsi roundabout or al-Kuwait roundabout. They als o target all thos e who attempt to rep air thos e streets."
Incident,"I stop either at al- Nabulsi roundab out, the 17th roundab out, or al- Kuwait roundab out, but there i s no coordinating point to receive this aid. The dangero us thing about the matter is that the drones [quadcopters] and tanks of the occupation advance while we c ross those areas and shoot at the people gathered to receive aid, often killing dozens and wounding dozens more.™ 59 84 According to the interview, the ˚e ld coordinator also cited an incident where the Isra e li military intercepted three aid truck driver s and ordered them to traver se the al-Rashid checkpoint at high speed under the threat of being bombed. This reportedly forced the drivers to run over people who could not get out of the way."
Incident,"60 85 The Netzarim corridor provides the Israeli military with immediate control over aid logistics, which it lacks els ewhere in Gaza. On 22 February, in the wake of the breakdown of aid operations caus ed by attacks on  police  o˜icers, Israeli  o˜icials  announced  their  plan  for  ‚humanitarian pockets™,  which  they described as areas secured by the Israeli military, in which cooperative Palestinian partners wo uld oversee aid deliver ies. They suggested the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City as a candidate for trialling the idea ."
Incident,"61 Israeli so urces have so far not publicly described any areas in Gaza as o˜ icially co nstitu ting a ‚humanitarian pocket™. However, attacks o n Palestinian organis ations facili tating aid near the N etzar im corr idor (see next Section) and third-party reports 62 both suggest this idea was implemented in aid distribution ne ar the Netzarim corridor throughout January and March 2024 , whereby aid distribution was overs een and moderated by the Israeli military."
Incident,64 Groups that refus e to cooperate have been targeted by the Israeli military (as discuss ed in the next subs ection).
Incident,"87 It is notable that while the Israeli military attacked police in the south of Gaza, compromising aid logistics there, it s olidi˚ed its control over the movement of aid into the north. On 12 March, the Israeli military announced a new crossing, Gate 96 , on the eastern end of the Netzarim corridor, ‚as p art of a pilot to prevent Hamas from taking over the aid ™."
Incident,"89 T his dual use of the Netzarim corridor for aid and military logistics contextualises the attacks on civilians se eking aid there. The Israeli decision to conc entrate these logistics in one place, in an apparent e˜ort to control aid facilitation more thoroughly, has had lethal consequences for civilians reliant on this inf rastructure for critical aid. It also undermined the notion that the US pier could e˜ecti vely operate to administer aid to northern Gaza. Rather than optimising the administration of aid as such, the Netzarim corridor, the pier, and the checkpoints compris e one logistical complex for intercepting aid and repla cing humanitar ian aid de livery systems with systems controlled by the Isra eli military an d th e US. Palestinian e˜ort s to develop alternative aid systems are n ot only forbidden within this infrastructure but are directly attacked (see next subsection)."
Incident,751 5˜ March 2024: At tacks on aid administrators 5.1 Palestinian organisations administering aid were targeted when they began to play a more prominent role in aid distribution. Attacks on these organisations were extensive enough to eliminate their key administrators or otherwise force them to discontinue aid operations.

Incident,"71 Civil service workers checking Palestinian IDs were also present at the scene ( Figure 7.17 , below). T his evidence suggests that local Palestinian systems of aid facilitation operated e˜ectively with a high level of organisation, while Israeli control over aid exchanges near the Netzarim corridor had repeatedly resulted in mass casualties. Together with the e˜orts by Palestinian Security Forces to divert aid receipt away from the Net zarim corridor, these successful aid deliveries demonstrate that there were competing re gimes of aid admini stration. Thi s helps to contex tuali se s ubse quent Israeli attacks."
Incident,"72 93 On 18 March 2024, Israel attacked al- Shifa Hospital for the s econd time (following the initial invasion of 11 November 2023), this time destroying it (see Chapter 5: Destruction of Medical Infrastructure)."

Incident,"775 1 2 9 In October 2023, as our databas e and timeline above demonstrate, bakeries were targeted when they played a critical role in aid distribution at the beginning of the Israeli military camp aign. The attacks on bakerie s corresponded to high volume s of people having be en se en queuing outside of them."
Incident,"Bakeries in the north of G aza were targete d ˚rst, and in Deir al-Balah, further south, s ubs e quentl y."
Incident,"130 In November, as our databas e and timeline above demonstrate, shelters were targeted as they began to play a central role in housing people displaced by Israe li attacks, as well as in the receipt and prep aration of aid following the destruction of bakeries. The highest concentration of atta c ks on she lters was during this month. Facilities for storage and prep aration of food at the shelters came under ˚re."
Incident,"123 131 Police were targeted when they played a c ritical role in escorting aid convoys following the opening of the K arem A bu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing. Attacks targeted o˜icers in their cars while they were e scor ting aid convoys or en route to facilit ate aid, as our timeline sh ows. This targeting prompted a breakdown of aid administration that compelled international humanitarian organisations to suspend their operations. Thes e attacks on police happened while Israel was cons olidating its control over the p assage  and  administration  of  aid  through the  Netzarim  corridor."
Incident,"13 4 Israe li vigilante protests and blockades on aid convoys were not confronted e˜ective ly and were reportedly supported in s ome cas es by Israeli s oldiers, as our analysis address es (s ee Section H8: Israe li vigilante attac ks on aid convoys and drivers). We documented six attac ks on aid convoys by Israeli vigilantes, involving t wo instances of violent attacks on aid delivery workers."
Incident,"135 Overall, attacks on eac h of these facilities were extensive and s evere enough to compromis e their operations, force them out of operation, or compel organisations to issue statements that they could no longer continue their aid operations, even after they had publicly declared their intent to operate as aid facilitators."
Incident,"776 2˜ The periods af ter which Israel increased the ˜ow of hum anitarian aid into Gaza (late December 2023; late March an d early April 2024; early May 2024) coincide in time an d space with an increase of Israel™s targeting of the means of distributing th at aid, including the logistics, personnel, an d infrastructure necessary."
Incident,"124 Days later, on 21 December, the Israeli military attacked the Karem Abu Salem/Kerem S halom crossing, killing the dire ctor of the Karem Abu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing. Also, in the s ub se quent months of January and Feb ruary, the Israeli military attacked aid personnel, which forced humanitarian organisations to suspend their operations, citing the danger of operating in Gaza."
Incident,"137 In late March and e arly April, par tic ularly following international pre s sure in re sponse to the de adly Israeli attack on the World C entral Kitchen convoy, Israel shifted its policy to permit higher volumes of trucks to enter Gaza. More food diversit y was s een for the ˚rst time in northern Gaza, and 9 A pril 2024 saw the highest number of trucks enter G aza since 7 Octob er 2023. In the week after, we documented signi˚cant attacks on markets, at a time when they were distributing food and civilians were heavily depending on them."
Incident,777 3˜ The targeting of aid occurred in tan dem with Israeli military™s evacuation orders an d coincides with its at tempts to force Palestinian civilians to displace from the nor th of Gaza.
Incident,"141 Shif ting aid to the south: Attacks on bakeries were predominantly in the north of Gaza and followed Israeli evacuation orders instructing all Palestinians to move s outh. A s the bakeries were eliminated, the necessity for civilians to move south was enhanced. Israel also opened the southern crossings for aid while keeping the northern Erez cross ing closed, which increased the relative availability of aid in the south comp ared to the north."
Incident,"142 R estricting aid in the ‚north™: As aid came into the s outh, the Israeli military attacked police escorting aid convoys to the north. Israeli attacks on aid convoys made the transportation of aid through Gaza more dangerous. During the same period, Israel e stab lishe d the Netzarim corridor (se e Chapter 2: Spatial Control), w hich delayed trucks m oving north from the sou ther n crossings, aggravating the lack of aid in the north. Famil y organi sation s that attempted to fac ilitate the distribution of aid north of this border were attacked at the same time."
Incident,"143 Impairing aid in the south: In the ˚rst eight months of the camp aign, Rafah was the main destination for displaced Palestinian civilians. With the 6 May 2024 invasion of Rafah, the Israe li military restricted access to aid coming from the southern crossings by seizing the Rafah crossing and attacking aid infra s tru c ture. It was also at that time that attacks by v igilantes o n aid c o nvoys moving throu gh the Israeli- occupied West Bank and Israel occurred despite the presence of Israeli soldiers."

Incident,"6 O ur anal ysi s of the relation b etween the cate gories of Israeli military conduct as well as the natural characteristics  of  the  landscape  indicates  the  following: (1) The elements of spatial control, the bu˜er zone, raid routes, and corridors (s e e Chapter 2: Spatial Contro l) were u tilised in tandem wi th the Israeli military™s evacuation orders to concentrate civilians in p arts of Gaza. The Netzarim corridor became an unp assable border, wi th checkpoints that d enied the retur n of civilians who we re disp laced to the sou th back into the north and restricted the amount of aid coming into the north (s ee Chapters 2, 7: Sp atial C ontrol,  Targeting  of  A id, Figure 8.7 , and Figure 8.8 )."
Incident,"(2 ) When layering the p atterns of displacement and those of the construction of the system of spatial control, outlined in point 1 above, further with the targeting of aid, particularly in the n orth, we n otic ed that attacks on ci vilians seekin g aid were more con centrated in proximity to the Netzarim corridor. This element of sp atial control created a division that put the delivery of aid, and civilians seeking aid, at risk. Acts of displacement, segregation, and targeting co mbined to ag gravate the co nditions of life (see Chapte r 7: Targ eting of Aid, Figure 8.11 , and Figure 8.12 )."
Incident,"(7) Th e destr uction of agriculture in Gaza an d th e t argeting of aid aggravated each other an d produce d food scarcity and famine. Studying the  destruction  of agriculture in relation  to the targeting of aid, reveals another compounded e˜ect : the destruction of agr iculture Œ ˚elds, orchards, greenhous es Œ restricted the possibilit y for Palestinians in Gaza to grow and obtain food independently, and the targeting of aid restricted and controlled food coming from the outside. With food s ources inside Gaza destroyed, food could only arrive though Israeli checkpoints, where its distribution was controlled and restricted by the Israeli military."
Incident,7 In the following pages we present relations b etwe en incident s and actions doc umente d in the di˜erent chapters of this report.
Incident,"The populati on that remained lives in da mag ed homes o r in publi c buildings ac ting as shel ters . Aid is r es tri c ted by the two checkpoin ts along t he Netzarim corridor (see Chapter 7: Targeting of A id). P rior to October 2023, al-Mawasi, in the southwest (l abelled ‚south enclave™), was an underdeveloped area of dunes and small-scale cultivation. Since October 2023, it has been increasingly overcrowded wit h tents and ot her tempor ary st ructures t hat do not provide su˜icient shelter from t he weat her and o˜er no privacy. The two areas have a one-way link between t hem - from t he nort h, s out h towards al-Mawasi - but not in t he opposite direct ion."
Incident,"Many of t he attacks on civilians s eeking aid occurred clos e to and nort h of t he checkpo ints t hrough t he Netzarim corridor. The attacks on t he map are unt il 30 J une 2024. (s ee Chapter s 7, 2 : Target ing of Aid, Spat ial Cont rol)."
Incident,"The status of hospitals on 30 J une 2024 overlayed with t he attacks on aid between 7 October 2023 and 30 J une 2024. This layering demonst r ates a spat ial and tempor al condit ion by which t he target ing of aid and t he dest ruct ion of medical infr ast ructure was most s evere in t he nort h. The e˜ects of t he dest ruct ion of medical infr ast ructure are aggr avated by s evere rest rict ion on t he availability of aid, result ing in a zone wit h a lack of life- sustaining infr ast ructure and aggr avated risk to life."
Incident,"Ag riculture destruction u ntil 30 Ju ne 2023 (shown here in bl ack), superimposed over clusters of attacks on aid (t he number at t he cent re denotes t he number of attacks). This map shows t he compounded e˜ect on food availability. In t he nort h, agriculture has been almost completely dest royed and most attacks on aid are recorded. The systemat ic dest ruct ion of agricu lt ure acros s Gaza contributed to food s carcity. This e˜ect was aggravated by the Israeli milit ary restricting and t argeting aid , incl uding food aid coming from o utside Gaza through the terminals and checkpoints in the Netzarim corridor. The compo unded e˜ect of t hes e two patterns is most visible in t he nort h, t hough it exists also in the s outh. The compounded e˜ects cont ributed to famine (s ee Chapter s 4, 7: Dest ruct ion of Agriculture and Water Res ources, Target ing of Aid)."
Incident,4 Such p atterns indicated to us that thes e attacks are organis ed and designed rather than occurring at random or in a haphazard way.
Incident,"5 T he interface of the GCD allowed our researchers to delineate a geographic region (within Gaza), a time period, or both, and retrieve information about all incidents we collected within that delineated domain . In this way, the GCD provided our res earc hers with the raw data with whic h to analys e potential relations and patterns bet ween incidents."
Incident,"7 The e˜ect of military act s on the ci vilian population in Gaza was reve aled by stud y ing the simult aneous, or proximate, application of di˜erent t ypes of acts in the same territory. We established the existence of relations bet ween incidents of more than one category."

Location,"18 37 Attempts to forcibly relo cate the Palestinian refugee p opulation were made again afte r the 1967 Israeli occupation of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, Gaza, the West Bank, East J erusalem, and the Syrian Golan Heights, during the Israeli military raids into Palestinian communities in the early 1970s. At this time, Israel demoli she d large parts of the refuge e camps in the north of G aza, Jabalia and al-Shati, and forcibly relo cated tens of thousands of refugees to Rafah in the sou th. Is rael aimed to rel ocate them to the al-A rish area in northern Sinai, but this plan was resisted by Palestinian refugees."

Th e patterns of displacement from east to west exist with th e continuous extens ion of th e Israeli-impos ed ‚bu˜er zone™ (s ee: ‚the bu˜er zone™ below).

Location,"13 1.2 The Settlements 41 T hroughout the 1 95 0s and 1 960s , there was no fence around Gaza. The ˚rst was erected after the area was occupied in 196 7, as a p art of counterinsurgency raids led by A riel Sharon, who, in the early 1970s, was the area™s military commander. Settlements were place d according to the s o - called ‚˚ ve ˚n gers™ Œ which saw settlement bloc s an d security roads leading to th em as th e means to bisect, envelop, and segregate Palestinian populated areas throughout Gaza."
Location,"27 43 Where the military- controlled road s erving Netzarim inters ected with Salah al-Din Road, Gaza™s main northŒs outh tra˜ic artery, the military established a large checkpoint and a bas e. The checkpoint was frequently clos ed and at other times us ed to monitor tra˜ic. By the end of October 2023, the area of the former Netzarim s ettlement was occupied and s oon after the Netzarim corridor was established (s ee Chapter 2: Sp atial C ontrol)."
Location,"44 Another forti˚ed set tlement was Kfar-Darom, the ˚rst Jewish settlement to be established in Gaza in 1970. It was locate d b etwe en the c entre of G aza and the south Œ which include d Khan Youni s and Rafah. Kfar- Darom was locate d directl y on Salah al- Din Road. Like Netzarim, it was a mean s of c ontrolling Pales tinian tra˜ic. It had an adjacent mili tar y base and was se rved by a securi ty road known a s the Kissu˚m corridor. Like the Netzarim corridor, it created a b arrier and channelled all tra˜ic to the checkpoint on Salah al-Din Road. In the spring of 2024, the Kissu˚m corridor was occupied and reus ed by the military to raid Palestinian areas (s ee Chapter 2: Sp atial C ontrol )."
Location,46 The Philadelphi corridor is a road and a bu˜er zone that runs 14 kilometres along the b order bet ween Gaza and Egypt from K arem A bu Salem/Kerem Shalom to the Mediterranean. It includes the Rafah c rossing terminal at the south end of Salah al-Din Road.
Location,"48 In 2005, Israel removed its settlers, destroyed the settlements and the military bases built in Gaza, and redeployed its ground forces behind the fences on the ceas e˚re line. Palestinian authorities us ed the area of the former settlements to construct public institutions, universities, and hospitals."
Location,"51 Over the years, and base d solely on it s own considerations, Israel has fur ther re stricted the ˚shing zone to varying extents, s ometimes to a mere three nautical miles."
Location,"5 4 Nearly all of Gaza™s energy is sup plied by Israel, both directly, from its electric grid, and indirectly, through fuel supplies to Gaza™s only electrical power plant.

Location,"18 1.4 The ‚bu˜er zone™ 5 7 During the al-Aqsa Intifada of the early 2000s, Israel ˚rst impos ed with gun˚re an ‚access restricted area™ of around 100˝150 metres into Gaza. In September 2005 , after the evacuation of settlements and bas es from Gaza, the Israeli military issued notice that Gaza residents must keep a distance of at least 150 metres from the perimeter fence. In s ome areas the military restricted Palestinians to 50 0 metres from the fence. After Hamas took power in 2007, Israel began to enforce access restrictions over a larger area, spannin g 300 metres to on e kilometre in some parts. From 2010 onwards, while the bu˜er zone was formally at 300 metres, farmers were allowed to approach up to 100 metres from the fence. No structures were allowed in this zone, Israel regularly bulldozed plants and structures in this area, and crops had to be under 100 centimetres in height. Israel enforced the bu˜er zone using live ˚re. It destroyed crops in the area using bulldozers and aerial spraying of herbicide. No structures were allowed in this zone."
Location,"39 59 In November 2023, the military announced an expanded bu˜er zone that would extend about one kilometre into Gaza, destroying cultivated farmland and undermining Gaza™s food supply."

Location,"Gaza is at the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean, and in the southern parts of Gaza the prevailing westerly wind no longer comes from over the Mediterranean, heavy with moisture. The result is that the north of Gaza is much lusher than the s outh, which is considered des ert.

Location,46 68 The al-Mawasi area compri s es the dunes of s outhwestern G aza. Its residents cultivated the land in small depressions dug between the dunes to absorb shallow groundwater Œ the Arabic nam e refers to water siphoning Œ to irrigate small gardens.
Location,"Since the end of 2023, this dune area was designated by the Isra eli mili tar y as a ‚humani tarian zo ne™ fo r disp laced peo pl e, d es pite lacking alm os t any infras tru cture to sup p ort the numbe r of p eo ple dis placed there. Even after Is rael designated the area a s a ‚humanitarian zone™ it was continuously targeted from the air and invaded by the Israeli military on the ground (s ee Chapter 3: Displacement). Survival in this zone p artially relied on Palestinians reverting to the area™s traditional ways of obtaining water by digging wells following the traditional al-Mawasi system."
Location,"48 The Ixil Maya inhab ited this area with dispersed homesteads surrounded by small subsistence gardens set in clearings within the otherwise dense cloud forest. We demonstrated how the genocide involved the complete destruction and then the recon˚guration of this environm ent. We docum ented the way villagers were systematically executed, villages were razed, ˚elds and forests were burned down, m aking it imposs ible for the population to gather foodstu˜s and medicinal and ceremonial plants. Altering the environment was key to the destruction of Ixil c ulture. Thi s de struction rendered the area uninhabitable and force d s urvivors to displace to areas under the control of the government. Alongside this destruction, a major project of construction and territorial reorganisation took place. Survivors were gathered into ‚model villages™ or ‚poles of development™, where the military controlled all aspects of life. Our investigation revealed how the destruction of the relation b etween their villages, their farms, and the forest environment they inhabited and on which their biological and cultural survival depended was an important element in their destruction as a distinct group. This was a well-honed colonial strategy known as ‚territorial reductions™ practis ed by Sp anish colonists against indigenous people to free up the land for colonial s ettlement. Further physical intervention in the landscape included the p aving of roads through the fore st environment. The se roads c ut and subdi vided the fore st environment of th e Ix il Mayans and allowed the military to travel unhindered across the territory."
Location,"75 This design aim ed to segregate the targeted pop ulation in a designated spa ce whose per im eter was controlled, sometimes fenced, or otherwise secured. Entry and exit into this space were also controlled. The treatment of p eople within these zones was markedly di˜erent from those in surrounding areas."
Location,"We showe d that a recurrent element in genocide is displacement. To generate displacement, the perpetrators often de stroy the life-sustaining environment from which it seeks to displac e the targeted population. By destroying the means that sustain the biological, cultural, and political life of the targ eted populatio n , the pe rpetrato rs fo rced the targeted groups to leave. The d estruc tio n and transformation of the environment was often als o undertaken to prevent the return of survivors to the area from which they were originally driven out."
Location,"76 In  both  cases,  destruction  and  recon˚guration  of  the  natural  and  built  environment,  and  the  relation between them, were used to establish con centration areas and exclus ion zones, and involved th e establishment of a series of spaces in which all life-supporting infrastructure was controlled. It was the architecture of thes e sp aces that made possible ‚deliberately in˘icting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in p art™."
Location,"82 Interp ret ation: Interpretation is the process of reading what the data pertaining to a p articular incident tells us. For text-bas ed materials, this means deriving the details of an incident, including its location, time, and context. Where necessary, our res earchers corroborate the claims of an incident with visual eviden c e found in footage or satellite imagery, which may capture the incident or its aftermath (see ‚veri˚cation and interpretation™). For visual mater ials, this involves c lose analysis of what is ‚in the frame™, and what is implied ‚outside the frame™ by the contents of the frame. This process varies depe nding on case c ontext.

Location,"87 The process of veri˚cation als o varies to meet the extent of interpretation and analysis required by the res earch objective. Given that the GCD is a cartographic tool, and that our res earch was concerned in substantial part with how impacts of Isra el™s military o˜ensive in Gaza had played out in terms of space an d regional geography, th e process of veri˚cation in this re search was often primarily Œ b ut rarely only Œ concerned with the question: wh ere did the events captured in this video/im age data take place?

Location,1 21 Figure   3.72 documents a checkpoint established at the inters ection of Salah al-Din and the Netzarim corridor which s urveille d Palestinian s leaving the sie ge around north G aza. The only safe routes for civilians evacuating from the north following the 13 October 2023 evacuation order required them to p ass through checkpoints at the Netzarim corridor (s ee Figure   3.79 ). Reports suggest that biometric data-gathering and surveillance through facial recognition software is in use at these and other locations (s ee Chapter 2: Sp atial C ontrol).

Location,A video published by t he Isr aeli military east of Khan Younis on 18 February showing Palest inian civilians walking towards al-Mawasi ™humanitarian zone™.
Location,The Israeli military invaded the ‚humanitarian zone™ in al-Mawasi and established a makeshift checkpoint within t he zone. Two ot her tempor ary checkpo ints were established in Khan Younis during February 2024.
Location,"222 2.5 The Israeli military used ‚protective measures™ to displace Palestinians 1 24 As noted in Chapter 2: Spatial Control, the military constructed a set of spatial e lem ents, including barriers, routes, checkpoints, and bu˜er zones across Gaza. The Netzarim corridor was established between north and s outh Gaza following the p ath of the 13 O ctober evacuation order. The corridor c reated  a large and impenetrable  barrier between the  evacuation area in the north and the  destin ation are as in th e south. Where the two main nor thŒsouth roads meet the corridor, th e Israeli military plac ed t wo large one-way checkpoints, allowing civilians to leave the south and barring their reentry north."
Location,"The construction of the corridor thus relates to the issuing of evacuation orders to the evacuation areas.  The  in˘iction  of  large-scale  destruction  in  the  evacuation areas,  and  the  construction  of  well- built physical barriers bet ween the evacuation areas and the destination areas suggests to us that displacement is not a haphazard respons e to battle˚eld contingency but a designed e˜ort that works in concert with other t ypes of acts performed by the Israeli military."
Location,1 26 The north to s outh displacement continued after the end of the temporary ceas e˚re in the beginning of D ecember 2023. G round invasions and evacuation orders pushed Palestinians from Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis towards t wo areas: Rafah in the s outh and al-Mawasi in the s outhwest.
Location,"By 20 Dece m ber, the Is raeli mili tary ground fo rces c overed most of the remaining area north of Wadi Gaz a and also large areas of Khan Younis in the south. Attacking from east to west and fr om north to south, the Israeli milit ary pushed t he populat ion in t he direct ion of t he s ea in t he west and Rafah in t he s out h."
Location,"61 131 From then on, the main direction of displacement wa s from east to west, with the single most important destination being the al-Mawasi area along the southwestern coast of Gaza (for context on the al- Mawasi area s ee Chapter 1: ‚Introduction™)."
Location,"132 This pattern involves displacement from the agrarian areas alon g the perimeter in the east of Gaza, which has good agricultural s oil, to coastal sand dunes in the west (s ee Chapter 4: Destruction of Agriculture  and  Water  Res ources)."
Location,133 The al-Mawasi area was als o devoid of su˜icient infrastructure for medical care and food. It thereafter became  the  largest  concentration  of  displaced  pers ons.
Location,"13 4 By 2 9 May, the Israeli ground invasion had fully s eized control of the Philadelphi corridor. On 6 May, Israel took control of the Rafah crossing, a critical entry point for humanitarian aid, and forced most of Gaza™s remaining functional hospitals in the Rafah area out of s ervice (s ee Chapter 5: Destruction of  Medical  Infrastructure)."
Location,"135 The al-M awasi area was alre ady struggling to accommodate an in˘ux of displaced people due to its limited shelter capa city even before the invasion of Rafah. It o˜ered limited a ccess to essential resources such as food, clean water, sanit ation, an d h ealthcare (see Chapter 5 : Destr uction of Medical  Infrastructure)."
Location,"136 The Israeli military funnelled civilians from the north of Gaza, as well as from the eastern part of the s outh into the al-Mawasi area through successive evacuation orders."
Location,"138 However, the Israeli military launche d a se cond invasion of that area, and our data shows that Palestinian civilians were forced to evacuate west wards into the ‚exp anded humanitarian zone™. Videos posted on s ocial networks showed many Palestinians displaced from Khan Younis for a s econd time sleeping in the open, as al-Mawasi was unable to accommodate another wave of new evacuees."
Location,"In Augu st 20 24, t he Israe li mi l itary invaded the eastern p arts of Khan Younis for a second tim e, p ush ing Palest i n ians who had ret urned to the area east of Salah al-Din Road back to the west. The Israeli invasion expanded west of Salah al-Din Road and into t he boundaries of t he ‚expanded human itar ian zone™ in al-Mawasi, which t he military had designated on 6 May 2024."
Location,"The overlap of t he Isr a eli ground invasion expansion into t he 6 May boundary of t he ‚humanitarian zone™ of al- Mawasi, wh ich was repeatedly cont r acted, shows t he con˚nement of t he largest number of displaced Palest inians in a small territory t hat const itutes 13% of t he total area of Ga za."

I am married and support my family, my children and their children. I have 20 dunums of land in the cit y of A basan al-K abira, east of Khan Younis, on the lands of Wadi Saber. I grow vegetables, olives and s ome trees on my land, which is my main profession through which I support my family. However, with the start of the aggression, I was unable to cultivate my crops becaus e we were displaced from one place to another. I began to be displaced after the Israeli occup ation entered Khan Younis. [....] One year ago, before the pres ent aggression, we were harvesting olive trees, but even then, we could not complete the harvest becaus e of the occup ation and our inabilit y to reach our lands due to its proximit y to the [eastern] ﬁborderﬂ area [with Israel]. Now we cannot reach our lands despite our return to [the area] becaus e it has been subjected to shelling and targeting, alongside its neighbouring lands. Our land was subjected to direct strikes and random shelling, which destroyed all the vegetables and olive trees that were planted, as well as the destruction of the water lines leading to it and the destruction of the infrastructure. Agriculture is my prim ary profession, and we n ow depend directly on aid and assistance. I have not been able to harvest any crops since the aggression and the occup ation™s entry into Khan Younis. We are now unable to provide for ours elves due to the high cost of living, our need for medical treatment, for me and my wife, and our need for healthy food due to our old age.™ 1 27 In a testimony share d with Forensic Archite cture by Al Mezan, A. , a far mer from Rafah states: 20 ‚My agricultural lands, which are 9 dunams in addition to 5 greenhous es, is located in the [Mawarij] area of Rafah, an area currently controlled by the Israeli military.

Location,"As a result, our databas e currently contains 998 incidents between 7 October and 28 October 2023, with 244 incidents geolocated to exact location accuracy, 264 inc idents to approximate location ac curacy, 209 incidents to neighbourho od accuracy, and 269 incidents to town/city ac curacy and 12 incidents to Gaza accuracy."
Location,"51 3 35 We use this database of exact location airstrike s and match them to are as of de struction shown in the 15 October UNOSAT damage map. By applying a densit y clustering technique, we identify sp atial con centrations of destr uction that corre spond to geolocated airstrikes. This allows us to study the p atterns of damage of each reported airstrike."
Location,"36 By analysing spatial p atterns from exactly geolocate d airstrikes and their clustered damage in thos e areas, we can identify similar characteristics in the surrounding regions. In areas where no airstrikes were reported, or where strikes were only approximate ly geolocated but visible damage appears in the UNO SAT layer, we apply a density clustering technique to estim ate likely dam age from aerial bombing. This allows us to interpolate the locations of unreported or imprecisely located airstrikes , estimating their imp act bas ed on the sp atial densit y of visible damage."
Location,"42 To speci˚cally identify dama g ed o r des troyed building s from critical and p ublic infras tructure, we match geolocated damage points from UNOSAT with the building outlines from the Micros oft OS M datas et. UNOSAT provides point data for each damaged structure, which we align with our existing building infrastructure location data to ensure accuracy."
Location,"43 Once the locations of damaged and destroyed infrastructure are identi˚ed using UNOSAT data, we conduct a sec ondary ver i˚cation process. This involves cross-referencing the locations of infrastructure with monthl y Planet satellite imagery to vi s ually con˚rm whether the buildings can b e cle arl y identi˚ed as destroyed. See Figure  6.4 ."
Location,"518 3˜ An alysis of street network dam age 3.1 Local accessibilit y analysis 45 We use the inc ident database and the UNOSAT damage layer to asse ss the impact of craters and debris on road accessibility near critical infrastructure. Critic al sites such a s hospitals or shelters were identi˚ed, and road networks adjacent to these locations were evaluated for damage that impeded vehicle access. Using satellite imagery, we identi˚ed repeated incidents where streets were cut o˜, blocking critical infrastructure such as ambulances and other vehicles."
Location,"46 Th e analysis map s areas wh ere road damage delayed or prevented access. GIS tool s are used to create vi s uali sation s of inaccessible areas, showing the proximity of road damage to critical infrastructure."
Location,"3.2 Road network analysis 47 For the road net work anal ysis, we us ed driving routes from OpenStreetMap for Gaza and identi˚ed road s egments within 25 metres of damaged areas, as recorded in various UNOSAT damage layers."
Location,"50 The ˚rst step focuses on de˚ning which road s egments are adjacent to critical infrastructure by creating a 25-metre bu˜er zone around thes e fac ilities. Road s egments within this bu˜er are considered ‚adjacent™ to the hospitals or evacuation corridor, and from these points, the shortest path distance is calculated along the road net work. This initial step establishes the bas eline accessibilit y, showing how  far  one  can  travel  through  the  remaining undamaged  roads."
Location,"51 9 51 In the second step, the analysis shifts to a hexagonal grid system. Each hexagon in this grid is assigned the shortest p ath distance to the nearest hospital, corridor, or safe zone. Aggregating the data at the hexagonal level helps to simplify the sp atial analysis and provides a consistent metric for comp aring accessibility ac ross di˜erent areas of Gaza. This grid-bas ed approach o˜ers an organis ed way to visualis e how far each hexagon is from key facilities, allowing for comp aris on of distances before and after road damage."
Location,"52 The third step involves calculating how road damage a˜ects these shortest path distances over time, at three key dates: 15 October, 7 November, and 7 January. By comp aring thes e distances with the undamaged road net work, the anal ysis identi˚es areas where accessibilit y wors ens. If the roads connecting a hexagon to hospitals, corridors, or the safe zone are entire l y damaged, the hexagon is considere d ‚disconne cte d™ from critical infrastructure. This distinction b etwe en distance increase s and total disc onnectio n is important for under standing the varying d egrees of a c cessibility loss, and  is olation."
Location,"This  technique  highlights  areas  with  signi˚cant  access  issues  while  maintaining  balance  across  the map™s colour scale. Hexagon s that have b ecome fully disconnecte d f rom the road network are marked in grey, making them stand out as areas where road damage has completely is olated the population from key infrastructure."
Location,"56 Ground invasion of north of Gaza: f rom 27 Octob er 2023 5 7 The gro und invasion proceeded in two directions s imultaneously. First, the Israeli military entered from the north, advancing south towards Gaza Cit y. Second, entering from the east moving west roughly along Wadi Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea (the area that would later become the Netzarim corridor, s ee Chapter 2: Spatial C ontrol) redirecting north to Gaza Cit y. Infrastructural damage and destruction dur ing this tim e co ntinu ed, sometim es p roximate to the ground invasion (see facto r of distance increase s ection), and s ometimes with no direct correlation to the ground invasion (s ee disruption of road access). As civilians began to relocate through the Salah al-Din evacuation corridor following the 13 October evacuation order, infrastructural damage and destruction leading to accumulation of debris on the path can be observed . This hindered e˜ective u se of the corr idor itself, but also rendered it increasingly di˜icult for civilians to access (see factor of distance increase)."
Location,"7 0 We anal yse d the times at which residential and commercial servic es were struck in the ˚rst thre e weeks of Israel™s bombing camp aign, and found that: (A) Strikes on residential buildings happened more at night than during the day Figure 6.11 The t iming of air st rikes in resident ial areas between 7 October and 28 October."
Location,"71 Our analysis of the sp atial distribution of Israeli airstrikes over time suggests a p attern by which Israel increasingly attacked areas after it instructed civilians to evacuate to them . After the 13 October evacuation order instructing civilians to move from the north to the south of Wadi Gaza, the average of airstrikes in the south increased."
Location,11 This resulted in an overall increas e in civilian deaths in comp aris on to the average number of civilians killed per day before 13 October.

Location,"36 For (a) , we began collecting information about attacks on civilians s eeking aid and collating them in the GC D (see Chapter 1: Introduction), spe c ifying the availabilit y of vi sual evidence, me dia sources, approximate location (neighbourhood or region), and approximate time. We subsequently investigated each incident to identify its precis e geographic coordinates and time where possible. As a result, most incidents have a con˚rmed approximate location, while s ome are geolocated precis ely."
Location,"37 Within our corpus of attacks, we include circumstances where the known presence of Israeli military personnel and infrastructure creates choke points for aid logistics where attacks on aid repeatedly and frequentl y occur.

The corridor ™s role in sieving aid is consistent with the stated aims of Israeli o˜icials to establish ‚humanitarian pockets™ that would be amenable to Israe li control. The points at which the Israeli- designated ‚safe routes™ met areas of Israeli control became the most lethal places for civilians s eeking aid in Gaza.

Pattern,"48 The Ixil Maya inhab ited this area with dispersed homesteads surrounded by small subsistence gardens set in clearings within the otherwise dense cloud forest. We demonstrated how the genocide involved the complete destruction and then the recon˚guration of this environm ent. We docum ented the way villagers were systematically executed, villages were razed, ˚elds and forests were burned down, m aking it imposs ible for the population to gather foodstu˜s and medicinal and ceremonial plants. Altering the environment was key to the destruction of Ixil c ulture. Thi s de struction rendered the area uninhabitable and force d s urvivors to displace to areas under the control of the government. Alongside this destruction, a major project of construction and territorial reorganisation took place. Survivors were gathered into ‚model villages™ or ‚poles of development™, where the military controlled all aspects of life. Our investigation revealed how the destruction of the relation b etween their villages, their farms, and the forest environment they inhabited and on which their biological and cultural survival depended was an important element in their destruction as a distinct group. This was a well-honed colonial strategy known as ‚territorial reductions™ practis ed by Sp anish colonists against indigenous people to free up the land for colonial s ettlement. Further physical intervention in the landscape included the p aving of roads through the fore st environment.

Cross -sectional Analysis 1 Thi s chapter is a synthesi s of the ˚ndings in each of this report™s chapters. It seeks to establi sh pattern s and relations bet ween di˜erent t ypes of attac ks and evaluate their cumulative e˜ect."
Pattern,(2 ) The patterns suggest that the re lation between the observed acts is not haphazard or random.
Pattern,"Ag riculture destruction u ntil 30 Ju ne 2023 (shown here in bl ack), superimposed over clusters of attacks on aid (t he number at t he cent re denotes t he number of attacks). This map shows t he compounded e˜ect on food availability. In t he nort h, agriculture has been almost completely dest royed and most attacks on aid are recorded. The systemat ic dest ruct ion of agricu lt ure acros s Gaza contributed to food s carcity. This e˜ect was aggravated by the Israeli milit ary restricting and t argeting aid , incl uding food aid coming from o utside Gaza through the terminals and checkpoints in the Netzarim corridor. The compo unded e˜ect of t hes e two patterns is most visible in t he nort h, t hough it exists also in the s outh. The compounded e˜ects cont ributed to famine (s ee Chapter s 4, 7: Dest ruct ion of Agriculture and Water Res ources, Target ing of Aid)."
Pattern,"The pattern of dest ruction of agr icultur al areas (up unt il 30 J une 2024), including orchards and ˚elds (black), large l y coin cide s with th e areas cleare d for th e construction of an expan de d bu ˜er zone, th e Netzarim corridor, an d th e raid route s. Th e dest ruct ion was focus ed on intensively cult ivated agricultur al areas on t he most fert ile s o il of Ga za. The rubble from dest royed ag ricultu ral in frastructu re and build ings contaminates the soil and ground water with long-term e˜ects (see Chapters 4, 2: Dest ruct ion of Agriculture and Water Res ources, Spat ial Cont rol)."
Pattern,"5 T he interface of the GCD allowed our researchers to delineate a geographic region (within Gaza), a time period, or both, and retrieve information about all incidents we collected within that delineated domain . In this way, the GCD provided our res earc hers with the raw data with whic h to analys e potential relations and patterns bet ween incidents."
Evidence,"2 Forensic A rchitecture (FA) is a res earch agency bas ed at Goldsmiths, University of London, that provides evidence and expert testimony for national and international courts based on analysi s of evidence concerning potential human rights violations , war crimes , violations of International Hum anitarian Law (IHL ), and other potential crimes."
Evidence,3 ‚Forensic architecture™ is also the name of an interdis ciplinary academic ˚ eld developed within Goldsmiths since 2010. The term refers to the production and pres entation of sp atial evidence within legal and p aralegal contexts.
Evidence,"5 Across our inves tigative research , we emp loy a suite of methodo l ogies in s patial and archi tec tural analy sis, op e n-source investigation , digital mo delling, and w itness interviewing using three-dime nsional digital mo dels (sp eci˚c methodologies applied in respect of this report are outlined in the methodology section below, and further, where necessary, in each chapter). We reconstruct incidents, including incidents of IHL and human right s violations, violations of the Genocide Convention, as well as conducting large-scale analysis of patterns of violations a cross larger terr itories and per iod s, by examining and analysing evidence obtained elsewhere."
Evidence,"6 Our work has been admitte d in legal process es in juris dictions around the world, including in the US, the UK, Germany, Guatemala, Namibia, Greece, Israel, and C olombia. Other investigations have been submitted to the International Criminal C ourt, and pres ented at the European C ourt of Human Rights (ECHR) and in the United Nations General Ass embly. Our director, Eyal Weizman, was a member of the Technology Advis ory Board of the International Criminal C ourt, helping to shape the early use of new media evidence in legal contexts. We have pres ented evidence in parliamentary inquiries, truth commissions, international media, and in exhibitions in cultural venues."

Evidence,"22 complete transformation of the environment where the Ixil Maya lived. The evidence was pres ented, cross-inter ro gated, and ac cepted by the c ourt. It was also re ported o n in the media, signalling i ts centralit y to the cas e."
Evidence,"78 All chapters are based on the following sources: ima ges, videos, and other m edia online, inc luding s ocial media net works; surveys of relevant media publications; historical, academic, and civil s ociet y accounts and reports; as well as cartographic res earch of current and historical cit y plans."
Evidence,"80 Collection : We collect information from a variety of media formats that include recorded videos, photographs, satellite and remote-sens ing im agery, written and oral testimony, and text-based reports of incidents Œ from three t ypes of s ources: (a) Using open-source research methodologies (see OSI below) (b) Sent to us directly from individual s ources (s ee Credibilit y below) (c) Datas ets shared with us by trusted organisations in our ˚eld (s ee Credibilit y below) 81 Veri˚cation: In relation to (a) and (b), materials are veri˚ed according to the veri˚cation f ramework outlined below. In relation to (c), we examine the third party™s data-gathering methodology and sample th e dat aset to determin e that th e dat aset meets our st an dards. If we deem it n eces sary, we investigate the  ˚le  using  veri˚cation  s oft ware  (s ee  ‚veri˚cation  and  interpretation™)."
Evidence,"82 Interp ret ation: Interpretation is the process of reading what the data pertaining to a p articular incident tells us. For text-bas ed materials, this means deriving the details of an incident, including its location, time, and context. Where necessary, our res earchers corroborate the claims of an incident with visual eviden c e found in footage or satellite imagery, which may capture the incident or its aftermath (see ‚veri˚cation and interpretation™). For visual mater ials, this involves c lose analysis of what is ‚in the frame™, and what is implied ‚outside the frame™ by the contents of the frame. This process varies depe nding on case c ontext. It c ould inc lud e ide ntifying the unifo rm s of sol dier s o r civil society pe rsonnel, id entifying the pres ence of emergency s ervices, or identifying any weapons or munitions (or munition fragments)."
Evidence,"2˜ Veri˚cation an d Interpretation 85 A m ajority of our investigative research, across case contexts , is founded in gathering, verifying, interpreting, mapping, and analysing digital media. The proce ss of veri˚cation en sure s, before a pote ntially valuabl e piece of ev id entiar y mate rial is map ped and analysed, that i t is au thentic. While there are fundame ntal practices at the co re of any veri˚ c ation process, the process varies across res earch contexts, depending on the form and comb ination in which material is received - that is, wheth er we are working with testimony, videos, image s, audio recordin gs, or some combination of each or all of thes e."
Evidence,"86 The data on which this report is founded are primarily images or videos, either shared with us directly, or found online, through a process of open-s ource investigation (OSI). (A small amount of information came to us as testimony, either directly or via third-party organisations.) In almost every case, that image or video data pres ents an FA researc her with an explicit or implicit ‚claim™ associated. That claim could be a headline in news media, or the content of a post on X/ Twitter or Telegram. Where a piece of evidentiary material comes to us with a claim ass ociated, the process of veri˚cation begins most commonly from the question: does the image/video in question show what is claimed?"
Evidence,"87 The process of veri˚cation als o varies to meet the extent of interpretation and analysis required by the res earch objective. Given that the GCD is a cartographic tool, and that our res earch was concerned in substantial part with how impacts of Isra el™s military o˜ensive in Gaza had played out in terms of space an d regional geography, th e process of veri˚cation in this re search was often primarily Œ b ut rarely only Œ concerned with the question: wh ere did the events captured in this video/im age data take place? For example, a large number of posts on X/ Twitter, published on 10 September 2024 claimed to show the aftermath of an air strike on the al-Mawasi ‚humanitarian zone™ on the same date, in which 19 civilians were reported to have been killed."
Evidence,"52 In the cas e of most of thes e X/ Twitter posts, the video or image its elf, in combination with other image data pertaining to the same incident, drawn from other posts, contains information su˜icient to determine the location of the airstrike as indeed within the al-Mawasi ‚humanitar ian zone™. Further, the ima ge, in combination with satellite ima gery from the days before and after, contains information su˜icient to determine that the airstrike indeed occurred on the day claimed Œ at the coordinates determined by the process of geolocation, there is no crater visible on 9 Septemb er 2024, but a crater is visible in imagery captured on 10 September 2024. The image, and other ass ociated image data, does not in its elf contain enough information to determine that 1 9 civilians died in the strike, a s wa s rep orted by Gaza™s health ministry."
Evidence,"88 A second example: a video p osted online on 29 February 2024 claims to show the aftermath of an attack on a group of civilians waiting to receive aid from a truck at the al-Nabulsi roundabout, near the Netzarim corridor. The video contains information su˜icient to determine that the incident took place at the claime d location. The content of the original vide o i s not imme diatel y, full y, and straightforwardl y clear, and thus a process of careful interpretation of the video™s content begins. T hat process of interpretation may involve cross-referencing the content of this video with other videos and images of the same incident from di˜erent angles Œ a process which requires that thos e videos are thems elves geo - and chronolocated and interpreted. (In this way, it is evident that veri˚cation and interpretation of multiple images and videos may occur simultaneously; image and video s ources may be mutually s upporting.) The original image and video may also b e cross-referenced with repor ts from news organisations, independent journalist s, and NGOs, until such time Œ as in this example Œ that to th e best of our res earchers™ understanding, the incident can be fairl y described as claimed: as an attack on  civilians  waiting  for  aid  distribution."
Evidence,"89 As the examples ab ove demon strate, veri˚cation i s a process which responds to, and is determined by, the available  evidentiary  material,  and by  the question s  that  are aske d  of  that  material, and  the obje ctive of the process: what about the material is a res earcher s eeking to verify? The process of veri˚cation is not (or not only) a set of yes/no questions; the processes of ver i˚cation and interpretation often overlap.

Destruction  of  Agriculture  a nd  Water  Reso urces 1 This ch apter  examines the  Israe li military™s  destruction  of  farmlands, greenhous es  and  agricultural infrastructure, including water infrastructure, across Gaza since October 2023."
Evidence,"21 Our analysis relies on the coverage and res olution of available satellite imagery. For example, heavy cloud coverage in satellite images during the months of October 2023 and February 2024 reduced our ability to con duct a Normalised Di˜eren ce Veget ation In dex (NDVI) analysis (see M ethodology) for thes e months."
Evidence,"26 Land cla ssi˚cation develop ed by Remote S ensing and Land Science Lab (SensLand Lab) : this classi˚cation visualis es land us e in Gaza in 2023 up until 6 October 2023, at a sp atial res olution of 10 m, using all available imagery from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. It includes ten land cover/use classes, ranging fro m high-d e nsi ty d evel o ped area to wo ody/natural vegetatio n."
Evidence,37 Cartographic  R e gression in this chapter involves comp aring NDVI analysis or satellite imagery from the sam e area to tra ck changes in the territory and determine how the land scape of Gaza before 7 October 2023 corresponds to the pres ent day. It allows us to map what has been destroyed at regular intervals and to deduce the p atterns of destruction over a long period of time.
Evidence,"The ‚vegetation index™ is an indicator of the health and robustness of plant life in a region over time, measured by analysing satellite imagery. We analys ed data for the month of June over a period of four years to maintain similar environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and rainfall)."
Evidence,"258 7.3 Destruction of greenhouses 52 Greenhouse s are a vital par t of Gaza™s domestic food inf rastructure. Working f rom satellite imagery from June 2023, we mapped every visible greenhouse structure throughout Gaza. We mapped a total of 8,339 structures. Some were in northern Gaza, but most were s outh of Wadi Gaza in Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah. In our classi˚cation, the architectural signatures of a greenhous e include: (a) a  rectangular  perimeter (b) a continuous roof with plastic sheeting (c) a  p arallel  grid  structure Figure 4.9."
Evidence,E xamples of greenhous es as s een in satellite imagery.
Evidence,"259 53 For a sample of the coordinates, we cross-referenced the identi˚ed greenhous e in satellite imagery with imagery from ground level."
Evidence,"260 5 4 We used before-and-after analysis of sate llite imagery, month by month, to monitor the status of greenhous es bet ween October 2023 and June 2024. We cate goris e d the status of the greenhous es as follows: (A) Intact Figure 4.11 ."
Evidence,Eight desalination plants were either damaged or destroyed. The status of 16 facilities could not be con˚rmed with satellite imagery.
Evidence,"66 While wells are challenging to detect via satellite imagery, we ass ess e d the status of water tanks through v isual ev ide nce using high-reso lution Planet Sat images. Their dis tinc t s truc ture is more easily visible from satellite images, and the CMWU datas et includes their coordinates, aiding identi˚cation."

Evidence,1 17 Satellite imagery from 30 November 2023 show s that this orchard wa s destroyed by the Israeli ground invasion. The surface area displays clear signs of ploughing by D 9 bulldozers and earth berms. The water tank feeding the farm was als o destroyed.
Evidence,"1 26 In a testimony shared with Forensic Architecture by Al Mez an, T., a farmer from Khan Younis (Abasan al-K abira) states : 19 ‚I am 84 years old, and I have been working in agriculture since 1980. I am married and support my family, my children and their children. I have 20 dunums of land in the cit y of A basan al-K abira, east of Khan Younis, on the lands of Wadi Saber. I grow vegetables, olives and s ome trees on my land, which is my main profession through which I support my family. However, with the start of the aggression, I was unable to cultivate my crops becaus e we were displaced from one place to another. I began to be displaced after the Israeli occup ation entered Khan Younis. [....] One year ago, before the pres ent aggression, we were harvesting olive trees, but even then, we could not complete the harvest becaus e of the occup ation and our inabilit y to reach our lands due to its proximit y to the [eastern] ﬁborderﬂ area [with Israel]. Now we cannot reach our lands despite our return to [the area] becaus e it has been subjected to shelling and targeting, alongside its neighbouring lands. Our land was subjected to direct strikes and random shelling, which destroyed all the vegetables and olive trees that were planted, as well as the destruction of the water lines leading to it and the destruction of the infrastructure. Agriculture is my prim ary profession, and we n ow depend directly on aid and assistance. I have not been able to harvest any crops since the aggression and the occup ation™s entry into Khan Younis. We are now unable to provide for ours elves due to the high cost of living, our need for medical treatment, for me and my wife, and our need for healthy food due to our old age.™ 1 27 In a testimony share d with Forensic Archite cture by Al Mezan, A. , a far mer from Rafah states: 20 ‚My agricultural lands, which are 9 dunams in addition to 5 greenhous es, is located in the [Mawarij] area of Rafah, an area currently controlled by the Israeli military. At the beginning of the war and until February [2024], I could onl y reach my land with great di˜iculty and fear, but we managed to plant cu cumber s, eggp lants and pe ppe rs o n it , and I u sed to take care of irr igating the cro ps daily and providing agricultural supplies, as their prices rose greatly, pesticides and seeds. Even obtaining water was expen sive becaus e we needed dies el to operate the water motor at times. The land and its crops were our only s ource of livelihood. But with the continuously intensi˚ed situation, it became di˜icult to reach our crops, and with the invasion of the cit y of Rafah in May 2024, reaching our lands became impossible. The latest we know about our land from s ome published photos is the destruction of 34 s olar p anels, the complete destruction of 5 greenhous es, and the bulldozing of most of the crops. My loss es can be estimated at around t went y thousand dollars, in addition to the damage to the s oil that may spoil the crops from the e˜ects of explosive materials, and the e˜ect of the soil being pulveris ed by  the  occup ation™s  machinery.™ 19 ˛ The farme r™s n ame was anonymised f or their s af ety by Al- Mez an Ce ntre f or Rights."

Evidence,"42 T his is because the Israeli military at tacks locations surrounding a hospital, allowing civilians ins ide to document these incidents in video and photographs."
Evidence,"When a hospital is ˚rst subject to ground invasion, visual evidence is still possible. People seeking shelter in the hospital commonly document direct attacks as far as they are able."
Evidence,"44 However, once evacuations of a hospital begins, fewer people are pres ent to record visual evidence."
Evidence,"45 For similar reas ons, visual evidence during the invasion phas e becomes sp ars e. Thi s is likely due to several factors: the detaining of civilians near military operations, the con˚scation of recording devices, and people™s fear of using devices in clos e proximit y to the Israeli military."

[Incident ID: 40 51249194] 105 By examining the locations of hospitals that were forced to clos e and evacuate, alongside the ground invasion and occup ation of the Netzarim corridor, our analysis suggests that, like the three hospitals in the north, the targeting of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital was due to it being in an area where the ground invasion would advance (see Figure 5.30 )."
Evidence,"415 1 27 The Israeli militar y targe ted medical inf rastr ucture across Gaza Œ conclusion 1 28 This analysi s reveals a long-term p attern of targeting hospitals across Gaza.

Evidence,"730 F˜ MATERIALS USED IN THE ANALYSIS 3 4 The primary s ources of data include: 1˜ Visual evidence: (a) Photo graphs a nd vid eos : Visual documentation from on-the-ground witness es access ed through the social media accounts (Instagram, Telegram, TikTok) of civilians, aid workers, and media outlets, to con˚rm the occurrence of speci˚c attac ks. These materials were geolocated to  match  them  with  known  locations  of  aid  distribution  points  and  infrastructure."
Evidence,"(b) Satellite imagery: High-resolution satellite ima ges from Planet Labs PBC were utilised to id entify and verify the lo catio ns of and the extent of dama g e to aid-related infras tru cture, such  as  bakeries,  shelters,  and  logistics facilities."
Evidence,"(b) Intern atio n al o rg anisatio ns: Reports from organisations such as UNRWA, Amnesty International, and others were us ed to corroborate and supplement visual evidence."
Evidence,"731 G˜ METHODOLOGY 35 Our res earch involves a t wo -p art analysis: (a) Collection and veri˚cation of visual evidence and reports, and analysis of incidents where aid  was  targeted."
Evidence,"36 For (a) , we began collecting information about attacks on civilians s eeking aid and collating them in the GC D (see Chapter 1: Introduction), spe c ifying the availabilit y of vi sual evidence, me dia sources, approximate location (neighbourhood or region), and approximate time. We subsequently investigated each incident to identify its precis e geographic coordinates and time where possible. As a result, most incidents have a con˚rmed approximate location, while s ome are geolocated precis ely."
Evidence,"38 We us e mapping and ge olocation te chniques (se e Methodology in Chapter 1: Introduction) to accuratel y locate incidents captured in visual evidence. This data is cons idered highly reliable as it allows for pre c ise identi˚cation and mapping of a˜e cte d areas, which i s critical for analysing pattern s in the attacks. We verify incidents using the incident veri˚cation criteria outlined in Chapter 1: Introduction."
Evidence,"42 W ith th e att acks collated into one database , we analysed spatial an d temporal patterns alon gside media and vis ual evidence, to identify any relationships bet ween events. This led us to conceptualis e attacks on aid according to discrete temporal phas es of attack where di˜erent types of aid sites and systems were targeted in turn or where suc h attac ks predominantly escalated (see the following subs ection). This identi˚cation of discrete temporal phas es, however, does not mean that the attacks in question only occur within a speci ˚c temporal phase; they occur elsewhere, b ut we have highlighted temporal periods where attacks of a certain nature are signi˚cant Œ namely because of other contextual information and factors that identify thes e periods as signi˚cant beyond the data its elf. A ls o, there are 732 s ome t ypes of attack on aid that do not ˚t neatly into temporal phas es becaus e they have occurred consistently since 7 October 2023. For example, attacks on UNRWA have occurred consistently (s ee Section H10: Attacks on UNWRA and decon˘icted sites)."
Evidence,"734 48 In October and early November, videos showed long queues of Palestinians waiting outside bakeries in Gaza. As a result of restrictions on basic goods, including water, electricit y, and fuel, many civilians in Gaza became reliant on bakerie s as a critical sourc e of food, being unab le to prepare food at home."
Evidence,"On other occasions, their solar pane ls or generators were hit. Four bakeries were targeted after images of Palestinians queuing outside them were posted online. A video taken on 17 October 2023 shows a queue at the Nus eirat bakery the evening before the bakery was attacked.

Evidence,"753 9 1 On 17 March, media evidence showed aid being delivered at the UNRWA HQ in South Rimal Gaza, and 15 aid trucks arriving at al- Shifa Hospital over the cours e of t wo days."
Evidence,"71 Civil service workers checking Palestinian IDs were also present at the scene ( Figure 7.17 , below). T his evidence suggests that local Palestinian systems of aid facilitation operated e˜ectively with a high level of organisation, while Israeli control over aid exchanges near the Netzarim corridor had repeatedly resulted in mass casualties. Together with the e˜orts by Palestinian Security Forces to divert aid receipt away from the Net zarim corridor, these successful aid deliveries demonstrate that there were competing re gimes of aid admini stration. Thi s helps to contex tuali se s ubse quent Israeli attacks."
