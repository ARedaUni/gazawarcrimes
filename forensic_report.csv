Introduction,,"1
 
In this chapter we provide a short acco unt of Forens ic Architecture, describe who we are and what we  
do, what methodologies we us ed in this report, account for the way this project began, and provide 
a short background to the di˜erent aspects of Gaza™s history relevant to the following chapters.

A˜
WHAT IS FORENSIC ARCHITECTURE?
2
 
Forensic A rchitecture (FA) is a res earch agency bas ed at Goldsmiths, University of London, that provides  
evidence and expert testimony for national and international courts based on analysi s of evidence 
concerning potential human rights violations , war crimes , violations of International Hum anitarian Law  
(IHL ), and other potential crimes.
3
 
‚Forensic architecture™ is also the name of an interdis ciplinary academic ˚ eld developed within 
Goldsmiths since 2010. The term refers to the production and pres entation of sp atial evidence within 
legal and p aralegal contexts.
4
 
As an independent universit y-bas ed research agency, we have undertaken over 10 0 investigations 
around the world, including in Mexico, the United States , Colombia, Indones ia, Cameroon, Greece, 
Bosnia, Guatemala, Germany, Israel/Palestine, the United Kingdom, and Namibia.
5
 
Across our inves tigative research , we emp loy a suite of methodo l ogies in s patial and archi tec tural 
analy sis, op e n-source investigation , digital mo delling, and w itness interviewing using three-dime nsional  
digital mo dels (sp eci˚c methodologies applied in respect of this report are outlined in the methodology  
section below, and further, where necessary, in each chapter). We reconstruct incidents, including 
incidents of IHL and human right s violations, violations of the Genocide Convention, as well as 
conducting large-scale analysis of patterns of violations a cross larger terr itories and per iod s, by 
examining and analysing evidence obtained elsewhere.
6
 
Our work has been admitte d in legal process es in juris dictions around the world, including in the US, 
the UK, Germany, Guatemala, Namibia, Greece, Israel, and C olombia. Other investigations have been 
submitted to the International Criminal C ourt, and pres ented at the European C ourt of Human Rights 
(ECHR) and in the United Nations General Ass embly. Our director, Eyal Weizman, was a member of 
the Technology Advis ory Board of the International Criminal C ourt, helping to shape the early use of 
new media evidence in legal contexts. We have pres ented evidence in parliamentary inquiries, truth 
commissions, international media, and in exhibitions in cultural venues.
7
 
Sin ce 2020, we have supported the growth of independent agencies worldwide that practise and 
apply our meth ods, in cluding in Ramallah, Berlin, B ogot
á
, M exico City, Rio de Jane iro, an d m any 
others. We often collaborate with thes e groups on common investigations.
8
 
We have rece ived international recognition for o ur work. Our cit ation for a Peabody Award commen ded  
the ag e ncy fo r ‚c o-creating an e ntire new ac ad e mic ˚el d™, w hil e our wo rk was hail ed as a ‚scie nti˚c 
b re akthrough™ which has led to ‚deep change in ex isting paradigms™ by the Europe an Re se arch Council .
9
 
The majo r i ty of our f unding Œ inc luding funding for the original research inc luding that which supported  
the original res earch from which this report is compiled Œ comes from academic res earch grants, and 
grant-making  foundation s  in  human  rights, advocacy,  and technology.

This report is derived from o ur ongoing research into the Israeli military™s conduct in Gaza and was 
provided to South Africa (SA) after being approached by SA to provide independent research and 
reporting for their ongoing submission in the cas e of A pplication of the C onvention on the Prevention 
and Punishm ent of the Cr im e of Genocide in the Gaza Str ip (South Afr ica v. Isra el, henceforth the 
‚Case™). This report is al so intended for pub lic dis semination and for use in oth er legal an d legal adjacent  
forums, as is consistent with FA™s mandate and obligations as a universit y-bas ed res earch agency.
16
 
The work in this report is derived from data gathered from open s ources or shared with us by third-
party organisations. FA has not received any mater ial from South Afr ica or othe r participants in the 
Cas e that is covered by legal privilege or by a con˚dentialit y order.

SCOPE
18
 
This report aims to pres ent p atterns of ‚incidents™ Œ that is, attacks or acts of destruction committed 
by the Israeli military Œ within the area of the occupie d Gaza Strip (hereafter ‚Gaza™) betwe en 7 October  
2023 and 16 September 2024. The se incidents include att acks on home s, shelters, hospitals, and other 
medical facilities; public institutions such as universities, schools, and government buildings; places of 
c ultural signi˜canc e such as c emeterie s, archaeological sites, and mosques; agricultural infrastr ucture 
such as ˜elds, orchards, greenhouses, and water wells; and infrastructure for the transport, storage, 
and  distribution  of  aid. 
19
 
The report als o investigates Israel™s establishment of ‚safe zones™, and announcement of evacuation 
orders, which have resulted in the rep eated large-s cale"
Introduction,,displacement
Introduction,,"of the Palestinian p opulation 
in  Gaza.
20
 
The report interrogates th e scale an d nature of att acks, the extent of dam age and th e number of 
victims, as well as the organis ed nature of the acts of violence and the improbabilit y of their random 
occurrence. 
21
 
The repor t seeks to identif y ‚pattern s™ within the se act s of violenc e , by which we me an the order 
of repetition of same, similar or related incidents , at di˚erent times and places . Such pat terns m ay 
indicate that thes e attacks are designed, formally or informally, rather than occurring at random or in a 
haphazard way. Pattern analysis is derived from the colle ction and veri˜cation of individual incidents. 
Our databas e is made up of all incidents we have collected and veri˜ed (s ee veri˜cation framework 
below) bet ween 7 October 2023˛11 October 2024. While our datas et of incidents is limited by what 
we were able to verify within the timeframe provided, our analysis of this datas et demonstrates clear 
p atterns of speci˜c military conduct and practices repeated over time and through space; we outline 
these patterns as ˜ndings in each of the areas of study. FA uses its professional expertise to determine 
the presence of pat terns but does not m ake determinations beyond those patterns directly observable  
from the data, nor does it make legal inferences or legally evaluate its ˜ndings.
22
 
To identify p atterns across thousands of data points, we developed an interactive databas e-mapping 
s oft ware. The General Cartographic Databas e (GCD) turns rows of data entered by our res earchers 
into a navigable ‚map™ of Gaza, within which it is possible to de˜ne regions, or periods in time, s elect 
certain categories of events (as above), and see all data which m atches those criteria . T his ˜ltering 
enabled the identi˜cation of trends and p atterns in the data.
23
 
The GCD all ow s us to s tu dy and prese nt patter ns related to all do cumented and ve ri˜ ed incid ents 
relate d to a single category of attack Œ for example,"
Introduction,,targeting of aid
Introduction,,", destruction of me dical infrastructure,  
or environmental destruction Œ across the entire territory of Gaza  bet ween October 2023 and June 
2024. Importantly, the GCD allows u s to study relations between incidents of m ore than one category. 
This enables us to consider whether relations exist bet ween di˚erent t ypes of attack.
24
 
We note that mili tary a c tio ns are mul tifa ceted, and patte rns c an exist a cross a c tio ns. The e˚ect of 
military actions on the c i vilian population may not b e fully captured by stud y ing the pattern of repetition  
of a sin gle type of action in isolation. The simultan eous, or proximate, application of di ˚erent types 
of actions in the same territory m ay generate a cumulative and compo unded e˚ect, each action 
consequently aggravating the e˚ect of another. Establishing relations between di˚erent types of actions  
8
can als o help determine whether thes e acts have b een organi s e d. Genoc ide is often understood 
as a process and a relation between many, rather than a single, act, compo sed ‚of di˜erent acts of 
pers ecution  or  destruction™.
11
25
 
The report goes on to o˜er a comparison between statements made by Israe li politicians, security 
personnel, and other public ˚gures against identi˚ed patterns of acts documented on the ground.
26
 
We consider a 
civilian status
 to be conferred on any individual who is not a member of an armed 
group or armed forces and does not p articip ate in hostilities.
12
 
27
 
We consider attacks on civilians to be any act of violence against the civilian population and civilian 
obje cts, whether in o˜ence or in defence, even if the attack does not lead to the death or injury 
of civilians.

The report contains an annexed study that considers the relationship bet ween a s eries of statements 
made by Israeli state and army o˜icials, advisers, journalists, soldiers, public ˚gures, and spokespersons,  
and the p atterns, nature, and conduct of Isra el™s military operations in Gaza from O ctober 2023 to

CONTEXT
30
 
Our p attern analysis extends beyond the establishment of relationships between contemporaneous 
incidents and s eeks als o to examine relationships to incidents across the region™s history. 
31
 
The following sections aim to provide historical context to the ˚ndings in this report regarding the 
current acts and conduct of the Israeli state and military. 
1.1"
Displacement,,"32
 
N early two million Palestinians, alm ost the entire pop ulation of Gaza, have been dis pla ced since 
October 2023.
14
33
 
On 13 October 2023, Israel ordered all Palestinians in Gaza Cit y and its surrounding region to move 
southward, a cross Wa di Gaza. The se paration of ‚north™ and ‚south™ Gaza crystallised into a forti˚ed and  
de facto internal border roughly t wo kilometres north of Wadi Gaza, known as the ‚Netzarim corridor ™. 
It is important to note that the"
Displacement,,displacement
Displacement,,"of Palestinians since October 2023 occurred from the 
comp aratively water-rich north to the arid s outh, and from the more fertile east to the dunes along the 
shoreline to the west (see Chapters 4, 3: Destruction of Agriculture and Water Reso urces,"
Displacement,,").
3 4
 
There are historical echoe s to thi s displac ement. Throughout the 1948 war, the Israeli military attempted  
to push Palestinians from north to south and across the border to Egypt. T he Israeli military was unable  
to dislodge the Egyptian army from the road between R afah and Gaza, thus Palestinian refugees 
remained in this sliver Œ or ‚strip™ Œ of coastal Palestine. 
35
 
A pproximately 70 % of the Gazan population of 2.3 million are refugees, expelled into Gaza by Zionist 
p aramilitary organisations and the Israeli military from 247 Palestinian trading towns, farming villages, 
and localities along the s outhern coast of Palestine, subsequently destroyed by the Israeli military.
15
 
By the time a ceas e˚re bet ween Israel and Egypt was reached at the start of 1949, roughly 200,000 
Palestinian refugees were trapped in an enclave slightly larger than 1% of Mandate- era Palestine with 
a  prewar population  of  80,000.
16
36
 
In 1952, Israel deman ded of th e UN an d Egypt that th e Palestinian refugee population in Gaza be 
moved to Egypt™s Western Des ert.
17
 In the early 19 50s, Israeli raids on the Palestinian refugee camps 
and on Egyptian forces in Gaza le d the UN and Egypt to make plans to relocate Palestinian refugees

away from Gaza and into the S inai desert along a planned freshwater canal from the Nile. Palestinians 
understood the plan as the denial of their right of return and organis ed against it. Palestinian protests 
culminated in 19 55 and managed to stop the plan.
18
37
 
Attempts to forcibly relo cate the Palestinian refugee p opulation were made again afte r the 1967 Israeli 
occupation of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, Gaza, the West Bank, East J erusalem, and the Syrian 
Golan Heights, during the Israeli military raids into Palestinian communities in the early 1970s. At this 
time, Israel demoli she d large parts of the refuge e camps in the north of G aza, Jabalia and al-Shati, 
and forcibly relo cated tens of thousands of refugees to Rafah in the sou th. Is rael aimed to rel ocate 
them to the al-A rish area in northern Sinai, but this plan was resisted by Palestinian refugees.
19
 Israel 
ended up constructing housing for refugee s ne ar Rafah.
20
 In 1972, Israel used the structures of the 
abandoned Canadian and B razilian UN camps, located on both sides of the PalestineŒEgypt border 
in Rafah as the basis to hous e the displaced refugees from north Gaza. The B razil Camp was abutting 
the border on the side of occupied Gaza, while the Canada Camp was located just beyond the border 
in occupied Sinai. Until A pril 1982, both sides of the old EgyptianŒPalestine border were occupied by 
the Israeli military and movement across the border was free.
21
38
 
The 1979 EgyptŒIsrael pe ace accord sign ed in Camp David stipulated that th e GazaŒEgy pt border 
would be s ep arated by a one-hundred-metre-wide strip of cleared land. The strip Œ whic h came to be 
known as the Philadelphi corridor Œ was to be fenced through the middle. The agreement allowed for 
th e res idents of th e Canada Camp to move back to occup ied Gaza . But I srael delayed the return of 
refugees to Palestine. For years, ˚ve thousand Palestinian refugees from the Canada Camp remained 
in Egypt without local work permits, waiting to be transferred. It took almost t wo decades for Israel to 
follow through on the agreement and allow the Palestinians relocated to the Canada Camp to return 
to  Gaza.

The Settlements
41
 
T hroughout the 1 95 0s and 1 960s , there was no fence around Gaza. The ˚rst was erected after the 
area was occupied in 196 7, as a p art of counterinsurgency raids led by A riel Sharon, who, in the early 
1970s, was the area™s military commander. Settlements were place d according to the s o - called ‚˚ ve 
˚n gers™ Œ which saw settlement bloc s an d security roads leading to th em as th e means to bisect, 
envelop, and segregate Palestinian populated areas throughout Gaza.
 
Military bases, roads, and lines 
of forti˚c ations we re buil t ove r destroyed Pal estinian lands. Tog ether, settl eme nts, roads, fences, 
checkpoints, and military infrastructure create an interlocking arc hite cture of control that put a hold 
on Palestinian movement and many aspects of Palestinian life in Gaza.
26
42
 
Settlements and settlement blocs created ˚ve wedges. The northern and southernmost settlements 
hemmed Gaza, while other s ettlement blocs cut the territory into three s ections: the ‚north™ included 
Gaza Cit y and the camps and villages that surrounded it. Bet ween the north and the ‚centre™ Œ which 
included Deir al-Balah and the refugee camps of Nus eirat, al-Bureij, and al-Maghazi Œ Israel erected 
in 1972 a large, forti˚ed s ettlement called Netzarim. The s ettlement was surrounded by s everal layers 
of fences and military bases. It was served by a m ajor security ro ute Œ meant for the exclus ive use 
of the Israeli military and Israeli s ettlers Œ that led from a checkpoint entry in the eastern fence (s ee 
Figure  1.1
). ‚ Securit y roads™ like the Netzarim road have been frequently us ed to fragment Palestinian 
terr itories throughout the history of Israel™s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza (see Chapter 2: 
Sp a tial  C on trol).
27
43
 
Where the military- controlled road s erving Netzarim inters ected with Salah al-Din Road, Gaza™s main 
northŒs outh tra˜ic artery, the military established a large checkpoint and a bas e. The checkpoint was 
frequently clos ed and at other times us ed to monitor tra˜ic. By the end of October 2023, the area of 
the former Netzarim s ettlement was occupied and s oon after the Netzarim corridor was established 
(s ee Chapter 2: Sp atial C ontrol). 
44
 
Another forti˚ed set tlement was Kfar-Darom, the ˚rst Jewish settlement to be established in Gaza 
in 1970. It was locate d b etwe en the c entre of G aza and the south Œ which include d Khan Youni s 
and Rafah. Kfar- Darom was locate d directl y on Salah al- Din Road. Like Netzarim, it was a mean s of 
c ontrolling Pales tinian tra˜ic. It had an adjacent mili tar y base and was se rved by a securi ty road known  
a s the Kissu˚m corridor. Like the Netzarim corridor, it created a b arrier and channelled all tra˜ic to 
the checkpoint on Salah al-Din Road. In the spring of 2024, the Kissu˚m corridor was occupied and 
reus ed by the military to raid Palestinian areas (s ee Chapter 2: Sp atial C ontrol
).
 Throughout the years 
of direc t o ccupatio n (1967˝2005), no rthŒsouth moveme nt al ong the Salah al-Din Road was of te n 
blocked and regulated by other permanent or temporary checkpoints.
45
 
There were oth er Israeli security roads that bisected Gaza. For example , th e Su fa Road, leadin g to 
the s ettlement of Morag (established in 1972), facilitated the s ep aration of Khan Younis from Rafah. 
46
 
The Philadelphi corridor is a road and a bu˜er zone that runs 14 kilometres along the b order bet ween 
Gaza and Egypt from K arem A bu Salem/Kerem Shalom to the Mediterranean. It includes the Rafah 
c rossing terminal at the south end of Salah al-Din Road.
 
 The Philade lphi corr idor was established in the  
spring of 1982, after Israel™s withdrawal from Sinai following the terms of its peace accord with Egypt.

In 2005, Israel removed its settlers, destroyed the settlements and the military bases built in Gaza,

the area of the former settlements to construct public institutions, universities, and hospitals.

Despite Israe l having removed its settlements and military bas es from Gaza in 2005, international 
organisations suc h as the Red Cross, the UN, the European Union, the African Union, as well as

The Closure/Siege
50
 
E xit from Gaza wa s regulated by other p ermanent checkp oints that grew into ‚crossings,™ or ‚terminals™.  
In January 1991, during the ˚rst Gulf War, Israel began to demand that any Palestinian entering Israel 
obtain a spec ial permit. This policy led to the s ep aration of the West Bank/Jerusalem and Gaza.
30
 In  
1994, Israel built another s et of perimeter forti˚cations consisting of an electronic fence, s entry posts, 
and p atrol roads, and installed permanent checkpoints along the boundary controlling the movement 
of people and goods into and out of Gaza.
51
 
Over the years, and base d solely on it s own considerations, Israel has fur ther re stricted the ˚shing 
zone to varying extents, s ometimes to a mere three nautical miles.
31
 In the mid-1990s, following the 
signing of the Oslo Accords, Israel further restricted the abilit y of Palestinians to travel out of Gaza. 
52
 
After Hamas took power in Gaza in 2007, Israel announced a blockade policy. It included prohibition 
on travel into and o ut of Gaza and severe limitations on the import and export of vario us products. 
Over the 17 years s ince, I srael has controlled the supply of es sential goods to Gazans: food, diesel, 
electricity, and other forms of humanitarian aid. Every commodity, provision, and person entering Gaza  
was regulated and reduced to a minimum. This included limitations on the quantit y of food (calculated 
down to th e calorie), litres of fuel, an d megawatts of electricity. Th e I sraeli milit ary calibrated this 
privation to a point that brought life in Gaza to a near standstill and created a humanitarian situation 
in which civil institutions, hospitals, and water and hygiene systems were barely able to function. The 
power shortage imp acted water and s ewage facilities. A bout 90 to 9 5% of the water pumped locally 
is contaminated.
32
53
 
The ‚humanitarian minimum™ was outlined in a 2007 Israeli military document, ‚Food C onsumption in 
the Gaza Strip Œ Red Lines™, which was made public by th e Israeli rights gro up Gisha in 2012. The Israeli  
report determined that the minimum number of calories required to sustain Gaza™s population of 1. 5 
million at a level just above the UN de˚nition of hunger was an average of 2,279 calories per pers on 
per day. Numerical for mulas w i th up p e r and l ower thres ho l ds de˚ned w hat the military called the 
‚breathing sp ace™ Œ which is to say, the time left before hunger starts killing people.
33
 They calculated 
the foodstu˜s produced in Gaza and the number of people in the territory. The total number of calories  
arrived at was then divided into cereals, fruits and vegetables, meat, milk, and oil. Thes e in turn were 
translated into tonnage and the number of trucks of international agencies to be allowed into Gaza.
5 4
 
Nearly all of Gaza™s energy is sup plied by Israel, both directly, from its electric grid, and indirectly, 
through fuel supplies to Gaza™s only electrical power plant. From 2 February 2008, the Israeli military 
reduced the current supplied by each of the power lines by 5% every week for the s ubsequent s everal

The ‚bu˜er zone™
5 7
 
During the al-Aqsa Intifada of the early 2000s, Israel ˚rst impos ed with gun˚re an ‚access restricted 
area™ of around 100˝150 metres into Gaza. In September 2005 , after the evacuation of settlements 
and bas es from Gaza, the Israeli military issued notice that Gaza residents must keep a distance of at 
least 150 metres from the perimeter fence. In s ome areas the military restricted Palestinians to 50 0 
metres from the fence. After Hamas took power in 2007, Israel began to enforce access restrictions 
over a larger area, spannin g 300 metres to on e kilometre in some parts. From 2010 onwards, while 
the bu˜er zone was formally at 300 metres, farmers were allowed to approach up to 100 metres from 
the fence. No structures were allowed in this zone, Israel regularly bulldozed plants and structures in 
this area, and crops had to be under 100 centimetres in height. Israel enforced the bu˜er zone using 
live ˚re. It destroyed crops in the area using bulldozers and aerial spraying of herbicide. No structures 
were allowed in this zone.
38
 
58
 
After Hamas took power in 20 07, Israe l further forti˚ed the perimeter of Gaza with more fences, control  
towers, cameras, and remotely controlled machine guns. In recent years, Israel reportedly placed an 
underground barrier designed to block cross-border tunnels.
39
 
59
 
In November 2023, the military announced an expanded bu˜er zone that would extend about one 
kilometre into Gaza, destroying cultivated farmland and undermining Gaza™s food supply.
40
 Israel has 
thereafter destroyed every building, greenhouse, ˚eld, or garden within the expanded bu˜er zone. 
Large p arts of villages such as B eit Lahiya and entire neighbourhoods in Shuja™iyya were eras ed and 
Palestinian c ivilians were displaced to the west (s ee Chapters 2, 4, 3: Sp atial C ontrol, Destruction of 
Agriculture and Water Res ources, and"

Agenda to resettle Gaza, 2023˚2024
60
 
In 2005, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was at that time Israel™s ˚nanc e minister, re signed f rom government  
in opposition to Prime Minister Ariel S haron™s plan for the evacuation of the settlements in Gaza.
41
 
Since the 200 5 evacuation, the s ettler movement, which now has deciding roles in the current Israeli 
government, has advocated for the rebuilding of the Jewish s ettlements in Gaza. 
61
 
Though Netanyahu said that the renewal of the settlement proj ect was ‚an unrealistic step™, and the 
government has not o˜icially de˚ned it as a goal of the war, over one third of the government publicly 
supports the settlement an d the ‚Judaisation of Gaza™. Th ese include Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich,  
who is als o a minister in the Defence Ministry with swe eping powers over the occupied West Bank, 
who said, ‚the cabinet™s war goal includes long-term control by the IDF ™, and added that prep arations 
should be made to renew the settlement of Kfar Darom, which was evacuated in 20 05. National 
Security Minis ter Itamar Be n-Gv ir stated that Jewis h settl eme nt in Gaz a is key to Is rael™s securi ty. 
The Israeli national-religious s ettler movement and lobby groups have supporte d the ‚return™ and the 
reestablishment of s ettlements which were evacuated in 200 5. As the ground invasion began, Israeli 
soldiers starte d rai sing orange ˘ags assoc iate d with opposition to the 2005 evacuation of settlements  
from Gaza. Soldiers made gra˜iti in di˜erent places across Gaza declaring the renewal of s ettlements

An Israeli military base establi shed in the Turki sh hospital on the Netzarim corridor, on the grounds 
of the former s ettlement of Netzarim, became the focus of the movement to res ettle Gaza. Soldiers

The western, coastal part of G aza mainl y con si sts of sand dunes. The eastern part, along the fences, i s  
a narrow band, roughly 35 kilometres wide, of fertile agricultural s oil (loess) where Gaza™s agricultural 
sec tor is located.
44
 The re is a s mall sectio n of even more agriculturally suitabl e clay soil in a band a 
few kilometres wide along the northern bank of Wadi Gaza. 
6 4
 
Along the seam between sand dunes and agricultural soil runs the region™s oldest route, known by 
the Romans as the Via Maris (‚Way of the Sea™), which originally linked Egypt to Syria and Turkey. 
The 40-kilometre-long section of this road between R afah and Gaza City is today the Salah al-Din 
Roa d m entioned above. The roa d is the focus of life in Gaza and was lined with workshops and 
small business es.

While Salah al-Din Road divides Gaza into an east and a west, Wadi Gaza divides it into a north and 
a south.
66
 
The draining of ˘oodwaters from the Hebron mountains collects in tributaries that gather into Wadi 
Gaza, the largest s eas onal stream of the area. It reaches the s ea a few kilometres s outh of Gaza Cit y. 
Throughout history, Wadi Gaza functioned as a defensive frontier. In European maps of Palestine 
from the nineteenth century, Wadi Gaza often marks the s outhern border of Palestine (the Holy Land), 
beyond which the des ert begins. During the First World War, the Ottoman Fourth A rmy set its line of 
defence against the invading B ritish A rmy along Wadi Gaza (this is the reason that the three large B ritish  
military bas es in Gaza Œ Nus eirat, al-Bureij, and al-Maghazi Œ are built on the s outhern bank of Wadi 
Gaza). In 1948˝49, it was thes e three bas es that turned into refugee camps bearing the same names. 
67
 
Gaza i s a climatic threshold. A nnual rainfall in the north of Gaza is 500 millimetres a year on average, 
more than double that of the south. The sharp de cline of rain responds to the dire ction of the coastline. 
Gaza is at the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean, and in the southern parts of Gaza the prevailing  
westerly wind no longer comes from over the Mediterranean, heavy with moisture. The result is that 
the north of Gaza is much lusher than the s outh, which is considered des ert. The border of the des ert 
i s a shi fting meteorological threshold and was marke d along di˜erent line s in di˜erent periods. Its 
northernmost location was understood to be Wadi Gaza and its southernmost Rafah.
46
68
 
The al-Mawasi area compri s es the dunes of s outhwestern G aza. Its residents cultivated the land in small  
depressions dug between the dunes to absorb shallow groundwater Œ the Arabic nam e refers to water  
siphoning Œ to irrigate small gardens.
 
Since the end of 2023, this dune area was designated by the 
Isra eli mili tar y as a ‚humani tarian zo ne™ fo r disp laced peo pl e, d es pite lacking alm os t any infras tru cture to  
sup p ort the numbe r of p eo ple dis placed there. Even after Is rael designated the area a s a ‚humanitarian  
zone™ it was continuously targeted from the air and invaded by the Israeli military on the ground (s ee 
Chapter 3:"
Displacement,,"). Survival in this zone p artially relied on Palestinians reverting to the area™s 
traditional ways of obtaining water by digging wells following the traditional al-Mawasi system.

We have previousl y conducted res earch and provide d legal evidence in two cas es that concerne d 
genocide. This included multiple investigations in Namibia and Guatemala.
47
 Both genocides involved 
the  di splacement  and  killing  of  indigenous  peoples, in  addition  to the  destruction  and  transformation  
of indigenous habitat.

On 11˝12 June 2024, Eyal Weizman and Paulo Tavares of Forensic A rchitecture presented evidence in 
the Guatemala Supreme C ourt in the trial of General Manuel B enedícto Lucas García, commander of 
the armed forces between 1978 an d 19 82, for th e genocide (as well as forced disappearan ce an d crimes  
a gainst humanity) of the Ixil Maya people in Guatemala™s west highland s.
48
 The Ixil Maya inhab ited this 
area with dispersed homesteads surrounded by small subsistence gardens set in clearings within the 
otherwise dense cloud forest. We demonstrated how the genocide involved the complete destruction 
and then the recon˚guration of this environm ent. We docum ented the way villagers were systematically  
executed, villages were razed, ˚elds and forests were burned down, m aking it imposs ible for the 
population to gather foodstu˜s and medicinal and ceremonial plants. Altering the environment was key  
to the destruction of Ixil c ulture. Thi s de struction rendered the area uninhabitable and force d s urvivors  
to displace to areas under the control of the government. Alongside this destruction, a major project 
of construction and territorial reorganisation took place. Survivors were gathered into ‚model villages™ 
or ‚poles of development™, where the military controlled all aspects of life. Our investigation revealed 
how the destruction of the relation b etween their villages, their farms, and the forest environment 
they inhabited and on which their biological and cultural survival depended was an important element 
in their destruction as a distinct group. This was a well-honed colonial strategy known as ‚territorial 
reductions™ practis ed by Sp anish colonists against indigenous people to free up the land for colonial 
s ettlement. Further physical intervention in the landscape included the p aving of roads through the 
fore st environment. The se roads c ut and subdi vided the fore st environment of th e Ix il Mayans and 
allowed the military to travel unhindered across the territory.
49
 
 Our exp ert opinion, presented and 
cross- examined in June 2024, showed that the cultural extermination, genocidal in nature, included 
a  s eries  of  sp atial  design  strategies  through  acts  of  destruction  and  re construction  that  aimed  at  the

In Namibia, we worked at the request of the O vaherero Traditional Authority (OTA), the Nam a 
Tra ditional Leade rs Associatio n (NTLA), and the Ovahe re ro/Ovam band eru Genocide Foundatio n 
(OGF) to collaborate in discovering and mapping the ancestral villages that were destroyed, and the 
concentration camp s and tran spor t routes that were constructe d, during the genoc ide perpetrate d  
between 19 04˝08 by Germany™s colonial army on the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in a territory 
Germ any had claimed an d colonised as So uth West Africa. In Febr uary 2023, a letter was sent by several 
UN Special Rapporte urs to th e government of Namibia, deman din g th e ‚meanin gful participation, 
through s elf- elected repres entatives, of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in the negotiations ... [for] 
e˜ective reparative m easures.™ They have also noted the ‚insu˜icient m em orialisation of the genocide™.
50
 
We have th ereafter worked with the OTA and NTLA to identify s ites related to th e genocide . In July 2024,  
our work was the basis for an Urgent A ppeal/Early Warning to the UN C ommittee on the Elimination 
of Ra cial Discrimination (CERD) about impending destruction of cultural her itage in the site of the 
form er concentration camp in Shark Island. The Shark Island Cultural R ights and Lüderitz heritage 
foundation have in cons equence withdrawn their cons ent for the development of a port on the site. 
72
 
The Ovaherero we re cattl e he rders in the region™s central plateau. In the early years of the co lonisatio n 
process, land was taken p iecemeal, until 1904, when the German colonial army destroyed the Ovaherero  
settlements around Okahandja and the foot of the mountain plateau of Waterberg. After that, the 
colonial troops channe lle d survivors into the K alahari Des ert, where tens of thousands succumbed to 
thirst and starvation. On 28 May 2021, following ˚ve years of negotiations, German Foreign Minister 
Heiko Maas announced in the name of the German government that it was formally recognising the 
atrocities committed against the Herero and Nama people as genocide, committing to work towards 
genuine reconciliation in remembrance of the victims.

The d ese rt thresho ld is an impo rtant geo grap hic al mar ke r mo bilised in at l ea s t one othe r case of 
historical gen ocide . Th e Armenian gen ocide by th e Ottoman army (1915˝1 6) involved uprootin g aroun d  
a million Ar menians and marching them to the Syrian d ese rt, w here many died of starvation, exhaustion,  
and disease.

In German South West Af rica , the ruins of Indigenous villages were trans formed into con c entration 
camps, military bas es, police stations, and colonial farms to make way for what German geographer 
Frie drich Ratzel terme d ‚ Leb en sraum™. Nama and Ovaherero survivors were sent to concentration 
camps, where they were exploite d for slave lab our to build the colony™s roads, rail ways, farms, and 
administrative outposts. More than half the pris oners died in their ˚rst year of captivit y. In one such 
camp, on Shark Is land, a windy and ex po sed peninsula ne ar the South Atlantic port of Lüderitz, 
captives were starved, beaten, raped, and executed.

poss ession grew signi˚cantly. The Ovaherero and Nama descendants of the genocide victims were 
con˚ned to ‚ethnic homelands™ s ep arated by main roads and railway lines. In both cas es, an important 
dimension in the perpetration of genocide was the design of the physical environment. 
75
 
This design aim ed to segregate the targeted pop ulation in a designated spa ce whose per im eter 
was controlled, sometimes fenced, or otherwise secured. Entry and exit into this space were also 
controlled. The treatment of p eople within these zones was markedly di˜erent from those in surrounding  
areas.

In  both  cases,  destruction  and  recon˚guration  of  the  natural  and  built  environment,  and  the  relation  
between them, were used to establish con centration areas and exclus ion zones, and involved th e

METHODOLOGY
1˜
Overview an d work˜ow
77
 
This s ection provides an overview of FA™s methodology relevant for the entiret y of the report. Section-
speci˚c methods will be elaborated in each chapter methodology s ection. 
78
 
All chapters are based on the following sources: ima ges, videos, and other m edia online, inc luding 
s ocial media net works; surveys of relevant media publications; historical, academic, and civil s ociet y 
accounts and reports; as well as cartographic res earch of current and historical cit y plans.
79
 
To introduce the various metho d ol ogies we emp loy, i t is necess ary to start with an und er standing 
of our work˘ow, which has ˚ve stages: collection, veri˚cation, interpretation, mapping, and analysis.
80
 
Collection
: We collect information from a variety of media formats that include recorded videos, 
photographs, satellite and remote-sens ing im agery, written and oral testimony, and text-based reports  
of incidents Œ from three t ypes of s ources:
(a)
 
Using open-source research methodologies (see OSI below) 
(b)
 
Sent to us directly from individual s ources (s ee Credibilit y below)
(c)
 
Datas ets shared with us by trusted organisations in our ˚eld (s ee Credibilit y below)
81
 
Veri˚cation:
 In relation to (a) and (b), materials are veri˚ed according to the veri˚cation f ramework 
outlined below. In relation to (c), we examine the third party™s data-gathering methodology and sample 
th e dat aset to determin e that th e dat aset meets our st an dards. If we deem it n eces sary, we investigate  
the  ˚le  using  veri˚cation  s oft ware  (s ee  ‚veri˚cation  and  interpretation™).  
82
 
Interp ret ation:
 Interpretation is the process of reading what the data pertaining to a p articular incident  
tells us. For text-bas ed materials, this means deriving the details of an incident, including its location, 
time, and context. Where necessary, our res earchers corroborate the claims of an incident with visual 
eviden c e found in footage or satellite imagery, which may capture the incident or its aftermath (see 
‚veri˚cation and interpretation™). For visual mater ials, this involves c lose analysis of what is ‚in the frame™,  
and what is implied ‚outside the frame™ by the contents of the frame. This process varies depe nding on 
case c ontext. It c ould inc lud e ide ntifying the unifo rm s of sol dier s o r civil society pe rsonnel, id entifying 
the pres ence of emergency s ervices, or identifying any weapons or munitions (or munition fragments).  
Through examining these and other features, our researchers piece together what can be understood 
of what has unfol d ed w i thin the incid ent c aptured by a piece of m edia. Co mm o nly, the p ro cess of 
interpretation al so involves cross-referen cing between th e subject dat a an d oth er data apparently 
pertaining to the same incident. This process ends by providing a written description of the incident, 
which is stored within our incident databas e and subs equently the GCD.
8 3
 
Mapping
: Once an incident is considered to have been veri˚ed, either as ‚con˚rmed™ or ‚most likely™, 
we enter that incident into our databas e, categorising and labelling it to include information such as 
sources , time of incident, location of incident. Each incident is given an identi˚cation number (‚ Incident  
ID™) compri sed of the abbreviate d date of the inc ident and a unique code (Y MMDD12345). These 
IDs are cited and footnoted where the relevant incident is mentioned in the report, s o that it can be 
directl y corroborated with information per taining to it in the database. All incident s that are referenc ed  
25
in the body of the text are liste d in the"
Displacement,,appendix
Displacement,,"of the chapter in which they appear, along with their 
p rimary source info rmation. Additio nal source info rmatio n c an be found in the GCD. Incide nt data 
is also pull ed into the GCD™s c arto grap hic inte r fa ce, w he re i t c an be analysed in relatio n to othe r 
incidents in sp ace and time. Incidents which are mapped in ˚gures throughout the report are in the 
GCD along with their s ource materials.
 
84
 
A nal ysi s
: This res earch work˘ow, from data colle ction to veri˚cation and interpretation, to mapping 
within the GC D, is intended to fac ilitate ‚pattern analysis™; a proce ss of reading the constellation s of 
data points with similar properties thro ugh which we m ake observations about the scale and character  
of a conduct or s eries of actions we are studying.
2˜
Veri˚cation an d Interpretation
85
 
A m ajority of our investigative research, across case contexts , is founded in gathering, verifying, 
interpreting, mapping, and analysing digital media. The proce ss of veri˚cation en sure s, before a 
pote ntially valuabl e piece of ev id entiar y mate rial is map ped and analysed, that i t is au thentic. While 
there are fundame ntal practices at the co re of any veri˚ c ation process, the process varies across 
res earch contexts, depending on the form and comb ination in which material is received - that is, 
wheth er we are working with testimony, videos, image s, audio recordin gs, or some combination of 
each or all of thes e. 
86
 
The data on which this report is founded are primarily images or videos, either shared with us directly, 
or found online, through a process of open-s ource investigation (OSI). (A small amount of information 
came to us as testimony, either directly or via third-party organisations.) In almost every case, that 
image or video data pres ents an FA researc her with an explicit or implicit ‚claim™ associated. That claim  
could be a headline in news media, or the content of a post on X/ Twitter or Telegram. Where a piece 
of evidentiary material comes to us with a claim ass ociated, the process of veri˚cation begins most 
commonly from the question: does the image/video in question show what is claimed? 
87
 
The process of veri˚cation als o varies to meet the extent of interpretation and analysis required by the 
res earch objective. Given that the GCD is a cartographic tool, and that our res earch was concerned 
in substantial part with how impacts of Isra el™s military o˜ensive in Gaza had played out in terms of 
space an d regional geography, th e process of veri˚cation in this re search was often primarily Œ b ut 
rarely only Œ concerned with the question: wh ere did the events captured in this video/im age data 
take place? For example, a large number of posts on X/ Twitter, published on 10 September 2024 
claimed to show the aftermath of an air strike on the al-Mawasi ‚humanitarian zone™ on the same date, 
in which 19 civilians were reported to have been killed.
52
 In the cas e of most of thes e X/ Twitter posts, 
the video or image its elf, in combination with other image data pertaining to the same incident, drawn 
from other posts, contains information su˜icient to determine the location of the airstrike as indeed 
within the al-Mawasi ‚humanitar ian zone™. Further, the ima ge, in combination with satellite ima gery 
from the days before and after, contains information su˜icient to determine that the airstrike indeed 
occurred on the day claimed Œ at the coordinates determined by the process of geolocation, there is 
no crater visible on 9 Septemb er 2024, but a crater is visible in imagery captured on 10 September 
2024. The image, and other ass ociated image data, does not in its elf contain enough information to 
determine that 1 9 civilians died in the strike, a s wa s rep orted by Gaza™s health ministry.

A second example: a video p osted online on 29 February 2024 claims to show the aftermath of an 
attack on a group of civilians waiting to receive aid from a truck at the al-Nabulsi roundabout, near the 
Netzarim corridor. The video contains information su˜icient to determine that the incident took place 
at the claime d location. The content of the original vide o i s not imme diatel y, full y, and straightforwardl y  
clear, and thus a process of careful interpretation of the video™s content begins. T hat process of 
interpretation may involve cross-referencing the content of this video with other videos and images of 
the same incident from di˜erent angles Œ a process which requires that thos e videos are thems elves 
geo - and chronolocated and interpreted. (In this way, it is evident that veri˚cation and interpretation 
of multiple images and videos may occur simultaneously; image and video s ources may be mutually 
s upporting.) The original image and video may also b e cross-referenced with repor ts from news 
organisations, independent journalist s, and NGOs, until such time Œ as in this example Œ that to th e 
best of our res earchers™ understanding, the incident can be fairl y described as claimed: as an attack 
on  civilians  waiting  for  aid  distribution. 
89
 
As the examples ab ove demon strate, veri˚cation i s a process which responds to, and is determined by,  
the available  evidentiary  material,  and by  the question s  that  are aske d  of  that  material, and  the obje ctive  
of the process: what about the material is a res earcher s eeking to verify? The process of veri˚cation 
is not (or not only) a set of yes/no questions; the processes of ver i˚cation and interpretation often 
overlap. Further, in s ome cas es, we have found that while the incident transpired almost as described 
in the ass ociated claim, the claim in s ome respects varied from or exceeded what can be known by 
the contents of the image/video material, and any ass ociated and credible reports.

Credibility
97
 
A process of ‚source analysis™ is used to establish whether an online source shoul d be considered 
credible, drawing on best practice guidelines for the ˚eld, including the B erkeley Protocol on Digital 
Open- Source Investigations (the ‚B erkeley Protocol™), and in line with established practices of other 
agencies in our ˚eld (including B ellingcat, Mnemonic, the Global Legal Action Net work, and A irwars, 
among  others).
54
  
98
 
Our process of source analysis carefully considers the online footprint of a source, including information  
such as its posting history, biographical or other contextual information about that s ource, including 
whether the source has previousl y poste d or shared reliab le material, and whether the source has 
an observabl e his tory of good pra ctice (inc luding accurate and ethical reporting , for example). The

Mapping and analysis
99
 
Once data is considered con˚rmed or most likely, after the process of veri˚cation and interpretation 
described above, they are entered into th e GCD to form the basis of th e as ses sments arrived at 
throughout  this  report.
100
 
The GCD is designed to facilitate res earch base d on the analysis of sp atial and cartographic p atterns 
over time. The GCD can be accessed at the following URL: gaza.forensic-architecture.org/database.
101
 
As de scribed above, each recorded 
incident
 is collected, veri˚ed, geolocated, timed, and tagged. 
This allows for a high multiplicity of incidents to be cross-referenced and studied in relation to eac h 
other. Our res earchers us e the GCD to move across di˜erent levels of analysis and identify relations 
betwee n 
incidents
, 
patterns
, and 
rep eti tions
 of ac ts of v iol ence across the entire te rri tor y of Gaza 
and throughout the duration of the con˘ict. The GCD is conceived as both a tool of res earch and as 
a tool of 
presentation
,  allowing  the  extraction and  pres entation  of  multiple  evidentiary  threads
. 
102
 
The GCD is a car tographic doc umentation of actions conducted by the Israel Defenc e Forc e s (henc efor th 
‚the Israe li military™ or ‚the military™) in Gaza since October 2023, including aerial bombardment, 
shootings, artillery strikes, bulldozing, and demolition, organis ed as discrete ‚incidents™, but arranged 
in s uch a way that pattern s and relation ships b etween inc idents may b e di scerne d. Within the interface  
of the GCD, us ers can delineate a geographic region, a time period, or both, and retrieve information 
about all incidents we colle cted within that delineated domain. In this way, the GCD provides res earchers  
with the raw data with which to anal yse relation s and potential pattern s b etwe en inc idents. All inc idents  
are recorded in local time (Gaza), and place names are translated into English. 
103
 
The GCD can display a variet y of media formats which can be retrieve d through direct links from the 
data points on the map. Thes e include videos, photographs, recorded testimonies, aerial and satellite 
images, and sound ˚les. The g eo grap hic base laye rs of the GCD inclu de g eo refe renced s atellite images  
and  veri˚ed  (s ee  ‚veri˚cation  and  interpretation™)  information from Humanitarian OpenStreetMap 
(HOSM). All data in this report is veri˚ed and con˚rmed as of 11 O ctober 2024. The GCD will be 
continuously updated as p art of our ongoing res earch. 
104
 
Note ab out the mapping of the Israeli ground invasion and ground forces presence:
105
 
Our ground invasion data draws on cartographic reports p ublished by the Institute for the Study of 
War  (ISW
)  and  the
 Critical Threats Project (CT P) at the A merican Enterpris e Institute, which maps the 
geographic progre s sion and extent of Israel™s ground invasion day-by-day, based on third-party source s  
from 27 Octob er 2023 onwards. We integrated two cate gories of data that CTPISW has mappe d: 
‚Reported Israeli Clearing Operations™ and ‚Claimed Furthest Israeli Advances™ in our research. We 
proc essed and mapped this dat a such that, for e ach repor t rele ased, we could see and asse ss th e 
furthest extent of the ground invasion to that date (in ˚gure legends throughout: ‚ground invasion™) as 
well as the change in the extent of the ground invasion since the preceding report (in ˚gure legends 
throughout: ‚ground invasion recent™).

FA Methodologies
3.1
 
Open-Source Investigation (OSI): 
109
 
OSI refers to a search for publicly available data on the open internet. OSI may constitute searches 
on social media, including use of hashtags, search operators, Boolean strings, and ‚reverse im age 
s earch™, to ˚nd relevant documents, such as photographic or video images and audio ˚les. 
3.2
 
Geolocation
1 10
 
Geolocation is the technique by which researchers can determine the precise place at which an 
incident occurs. A de˚nition is provided in the Berkeley Protocol on Digital Op en Source Investigations:
111
 
‚Geolocation  is  the  identi˚cation  or  estimation  of  the  location of  an  object,  an  activit y or  the  location  
from which an ite m was generated. Fo r example, it may be possible to deter mine the location from 
which a video or photograph downloaded from the Internet was taken using geolocation techniques. 
Such techniques could include, for example, identifying unique geographic features in a photograph 
with their actual location on a map.™
57
3.3
 
Chronolocation
112
 
Chronolocation is the technique by which res earchers identify, approximately or precis ely, what date 
or tim e an image or video was captured by reference to the contents of an ima ge fram e, or digital 
information contained within the ˚le. The approximate time at which an image or video was captured 
can be determined by reference to the ˚le™s metadata, by shadow s visible within the frame, or by 
synchronisation  with  other  media.

We identi˛ed several key elements of the Israeli military™s present system of"
Spatial Control,,spatial control

(a)
 
A 1km-wide ‚bu˜er zone™ along the eastern perimeter of Gaza. Most buildings and all agricultural  
installations have been destroyed within this zone. 
(b)
 
The Netzarim corridor, running east to west, b is ecting Gaza north of Wadi Gaza. The corridor 
is compos ed of a 6. 5 km-long road with 2˝3. 5 km of cleared margins on its s outh side and 
1.7˝3. 5 km on its north side, within which most buildings and agricultural infrastructure have 
been destroyed. 
(c)
 
Two permanent checkpoints at the inters ections of the Netzarim corridor, with the t wo main 
northŒs outh tra˜ic arteries, Salah al-Din Road and al-Rashid Road. We als o identi˚ed and 
analys ed four temporary checkpoints throughout Gaza, operational at di˜erent times.
(d )
 
Thirteen raid route s le ading f rom Israeli military base s outside of Gaza into G aza. The 
construction or widening of these roads of ten involved the destruction of most buildings 
and all agricultural lands in their p ath.
(e)
 
The Philadelphi corr idor, running east to west along Gaza™s entire southern border with Egypt.
1.2
 
We also found that:
(a)
 
The total area destroyed and cleared for the establishment of the four new elements above is 
131.7 s q k m, which constitutes 36% of the total area of Gaza. The bu˜er zone, the ‚corridors™, 
and  the  raid  routes  p artially  overlap.
(b)
 
The area destroyed and cleared for the bu˜er zone amounts to 55 s q km, which constitutes 
15% of Gaza.
(c)
 
Th e surfac e are a of th e Netzarim corridor amount s to 35 sq km , which constitutes 9.6% of 
Gaza. The clearing of land for the corridor led to the destruction of ˚ve universit y buildings, 
a courthous e, a hospital, t wo res orts, a p ark, and a wastewater treatment facilit y.
(d )
 
The area of land cleared for the bene˚t of the raid routes constitutes 62 s q km.

The area of the exp anded Philadelphi corridor amounts to 10.8 s q km.

Pat tern ˚n dings
1 16
 
Israel™s military camp aign in Gaza bet ween 7 October 2023 and 30 June 2024 involved the reshaping 
of the cultivated and built environment of the region through a cts of 
destruction
 and 
construction
. 
Large tracts of territory were cleared, in cludin g agricultural areas an d buildin gs. In th eir place, the 
Israeli military constructed roads, temporary encampments, permanent bas es, lines of forti˚cation, and  
checkpoints. Our analysis found that thes e acts of destruction and construction were not haphazard, 
but followed consistent and clear sp atial logic:
2.1
 
All agricultural ˛elds, orchards, greenhouses, and other agriculture where the bu˜er zone, the 
corridors, and the raid routes were established have been destroyed. The construction of these 
new infrastructural elements has likely contaminated the soil, inhibiting future use (see Chapter 4:"
Destruction of Agriculture and Water Resources,,"). 
2.2
 
The Netzarim corridor divides Gaza into two ‚zones™: 
(a)
 
The ‚north™, from which Israel ordered the evacuation of civilians
(b)
 
The ‚south™, which include s ‚destination are as™ (see Section A (Glo s sary) in Chapter 3:"
Displacement,,") 
2.3
 
These zones are separated by checkpoints where Gaza™s main nor thŒsouth roads cross the 
Netzarim corridor.
2.4
 
The Netzarim corridor and the checkpoints facilitate"
Displacement,,displacement
Displacement,,": 
(a)
 
Movement bet ween the zones mentioned is restricted and controlled by checkpoints. 
(b)
 
The checkpoints exclusively allow for one-way movement by civilians from the north to the 
s outh (s ee Chapter 3:"
Displacement,,") and aid from ‚s outh™ to ‚north™ (s ee Chapter 7: Targeting 
of  A id).
2.5
 
Thirteen raid routes lead from the perimeter to the interior of Gaza. These routes facilitated 
repeated military incursions, and the extent of work invested in their construction suggests they 
may have long-term presence and be fur ther employed for this purpose.
2.6
 
The majority of buildings in areas where the bu˜er zone, the corridors, and the raid routes were 
established have been destroyed.
2.7
 
The territorial reorganisation of Gaza is consistent with statements made by Israeli political 
leaders calling for a long-term Israeli military presence and the construction of permanent Jewish 
settlements in Gaza.

2.8
 
The territorial arrangement imposed on Gaza through the abovementioned elements is key 
to understanding other dimensions of Israel™s military campaign, such as the destruction of 
agriculture, the"

orders. 
(a)
 
The 13 October evacuation order covered 37% of the total area of Gaza.
(b)
 
After the grid-bas ed evacuation orders were introduced on 1 December, most areas in Gaza 
were ordered to evacuate at least once. B et ween 1 December 2023 and 31 August 2024, 72 
percent of Gaza™s total area was subject to evacuation orders.
(c)
 
By 6 May, only 6.9 percent (25.3 s q km) of areas in Gaza, excluding the area of the ‚humanitarian  
zone™, had not received an evacuation order yet.

2.1
 
The Israeli military repeatedly targeted medical infrastructure across Gaza.
(A)
 
The Israeli military™s targeting of hospitals follows a consistent and discernible pattern of ˛ve 
t ypically consecutive phases:
(a)
 
Evacuation orders and warnings (27 hospitals)
(b)
 
Attacking the surroundings of hospitals (2 9 hospitals)
(c)
 
Direct attacks on hospitals (31 hospitals)
(d )
 
Putting hospitals under siege (11 hospitals)

Invading hospitals (10 hospitals)
(B)
 
The Israeli military™s attacking of hospitals correlates with the advancement and presence of Israeli 
ground forces:

2.1
 
Our analysis of the ˛rst three weeks of the aerial bombing campaign in Gaza (7˚28 October 2023) 
indicates: 
(A)
 
The timing of the Israeli military™s airstrikes on speci˛c infrastructure correlates with the time at 
which a higher density of civilians would be expected to be present.
(a)
 
Strikes on residential buildings happened more at night than during the day. 
(b)
 
Strikes on c ommercial s paces, including bake ries and markets happened more during 
operational hours than outside of operational hours.
(B)
 
Israel™s attacks south of Wadi Gaza increased after it ordered civilians from the nor th to evacuate to 
the south.
2.2
 
Our analysis of the ˛rst ten months of Israel™s military campaign in Gaza (7 OctoberŒ6 July) 
indicates:
(A)
 
Public infrastructure was destroyed even after it had been previously damaged, and when it was 
unlikely to be occupied.
(B)
 
Areas in proximit y to critical infrastructure were targeted: 
(a)
 
We observed repeated damage to service roads imm ediately surrounding cr itical infrastructure.
(b)
 
We obs erved repeated destruction of buildings in the same vicinit y, leading to accumulation 
of debris on the roads surrounding critical infrastructure.
(C)
 
Repeated disruption of road networks isolated civilians in two ways:
(a)
 
It was more di˜icult for civilians to leave areas in which infrastructure had been destroyed.
(b)
 
It was more di˜icult for aid to reach civilians in th ose areas disconn ected from th e road n etwork.

Quantitative ˜n dings
1.1
 
We documented 322 incidents of aid-targeting between 7 October 2023 and 16 September 2024. 
Of which:
(a)
 
17 attacks were on bakeries
(b)
 
73 attacks were on shelters for displaced Palestinians, such as UNRWA-run schools, where 
food aid was received and distributed
(c)
 
60 attacks were on aid pers onnel
(d )
 
50 attacks were on civilians seeking aid Œ 37 of these occur red just north of the Netzarim 
corridor between January and March 2024. (More civilians were killed in attac ks which we 
have classi˜ed as attacks on other targets.)
(e)
 
78 attacks were on aid infrastructure, such as warehous es and water treatment facilities
(f)
 
22 attacks were on convoys of trucks transp orting aid through Gaza, which were coordinated 
by  humanitarian  aid  organisations  
(g)
 
6 attacks were on aid convoys en route to Gaza through Israel or the occupied West Bank, 
carried  out  by  Israeli  vigilantes  during  May  2024
(h)
 
16 attacks were on markets where aid was being obtained by civilians
(i)
 
At least 17 of the attacks on aid pers onnel, convoys, and infrastructure targeted sites involved 
in operations that had been o˚icially coordinated with Israe l and recognis ed as ‚decon˛icted 
sites™, understood to be exempt from Israeli military targeting, or ‚safe™.
1.2
 
We documented the following attacks on aid sites and systems operated by UNRWA:
(a)
 
Among the attacks on aid p ersonnel, convoys , and infra structure, at lea st 39 were on UNRWA  
personnel, facilities, or vehicles. 
(b)
 
In total, 195 UNRWA personnel were killed, including 177 sta˚ members and 18 other aid workers.
(c)
 
A nother 40 UNRWA sta˚ members have been detained by the Israeli military.

2˜
Pat tern ˚n dings
2.1
 
Our analysis indicates that the Israeli military targeted sites and systems of aid distribution when 
and where they became the main mode of aid facilitation. We observed that this targeting followed 
a pattern of overlapping phases, during which attacks on the speci˛ed aid categories intensi˛ed:
(a)
 
Octob erŒNovemb er 2023: Bakeries 
in the north of Gaza were targeted when they played a 
critical  role  in  aid distribution,  
during October and early Novemb er 2023.
 By mid-November, 
there were no o˜icial bakeries still in operation in Gaza Cit y. 
(b)
 
Octob er 2023˛Januar y 2024: She lters
 were targeted when they assume d a central role in 
housing people displaced by Israeli attacks, and facilitating the receipt and preparation of 
food aid, 
f rom 13 Octob er to Decemb er 2023.
(c)
 
December 2023˛February 2024: Pales tinian police o˝icers
, who we cate gorise as 
ai d 
personnel
, were targeted when they played a critical role in escorting aid convoys.
(d )
 
Januar yŒMarch 2024: Civilian s
 were targeted when gathering to receive aid from aid trucks 
that p ass ed through the Netzarim corridor checkpoints into northern Gaza 
f rom Januar y to 
March 2024.
(e)
 
March 2024: Aid a dminis trators
 from Palestinian organisations and groups that took up 
respons ibility for facilitating aid delivery and distribution, who we categorise as 
aid pe r so nn el
, 
we re targ eted whe n they began to play a p ro mine nt ro l e 
in Ma rch 2024
. Atta cks o n these 
personnel and organi sation s were ex ten sive and deadly enough to eliminate their key 
administrators or otherwise force them to cease operating.
(f)
 
October 2023, De cember 2023, and May 2024: Aid distribution and stor age sites
, in clud ing  
warehouse s and market s, were targeted when they were acti vely operating to supply ci vilians 
with food, with severe at tacks on Rafah crossing, Karem Abu S alem/Kerem Shalom crossing, 
and markets during periods of increased aid- entering.
(g)
 
May 2024: Israeli vigilantes
 attacked aid convoys p assing through Israel and the occupied 
West Bank under the watch and sometimes with direct support of Israeli military pers onnel. 
2.2
 
The periods after which Israel increased the ˝ow of humanitarian aid into Gaza (late December 
2023; late March and early April 2024; early May 2024) coincide in time and space with an 
increase of Israel™s targeting of the means of distributing that aid, including the logistics, personnel, 
and infrastructure necessary.
2.3
 
The"

with its attempts to force Palestinian civilians to displace from the nor th of Gaza. The construction 
of the new internal border in the Netzarim corridor and the checkpoints within it supporting a 
one-way (north to south) movement of civilians coincided with the restriction of aid as a means of"

This c hapter examines the Israeli military™s system of sp atial control in Gaza, including the bu˜er zone, 
the Netzarim corridor, the raid routes, and the Philadelphi corridor since October 2023.

A˜
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
1˜
Quantitative ˚n dings
1.1
 
We identi˛ed several key elements of the Israeli military™s present system of"
Targeting of Aid,,spatial control
Targeting of Aid,,"in Gaza: 
(a)
 
A 1km-wide ‚bu˜er zone™ along the eastern perimeter of Gaza. Most buildings and all agricultural  
installations have been destroyed within this zone. 
(b)
 
The Netzarim corridor, running east to west, b is ecting Gaza north of Wadi Gaza. The corridor 
is compos ed of a 6. 5 km-long road with 2˝3. 5 km of cleared margins on its s outh side and 
1.7˝3. 5 km on its north side, within which most buildings and agricultural infrastructure have 
been destroyed. 
(c)
 
Two permanent checkpoints at the inters ections of the Netzarim corridor, with the t wo main 
northŒs outh tra˜ic arteries, Salah al-Din Road and al-Rashid Road. We als o identi˚ed and 
analys ed four temporary checkpoints throughout Gaza, operational at di˜erent times.
(d )
 
Thirteen raid route s le ading f rom Israeli military base s outside of Gaza into G aza. The 
construction or widening of these roads of ten involved the destruction of most buildings 
and all agricultural lands in their p ath.
(e)
 
The Philadelphi corr idor, running east to west along Gaza™s entire southern border with Egypt.
1.2
 
We also found that:
(a)
 
The total area destroyed and cleared for the establishment of the four new elements above is 
131.7 s q k m, which constitutes 36% of the total area of Gaza. The bu˜er zone, the ‚corridors™, 
and  the  raid  routes  p artially  overlap.
(b)
 
The area destroyed and cleared for the bu˜er zone amounts to 55 s q km, which constitutes 
15% of Gaza.
(c)
 
Th e surfac e are a of th e Netzarim corridor amount s to 35 sq km , which constitutes 9.6% of 
Gaza. The clearing of land for the corridor led to the destruction of ˚ve universit y buildings, 
a courthous e, a hospital, t wo res orts, a p ark, and a wastewater treatment facilit y.
(d )
 
The area of land cleared for the bene˚t of the raid routes constitutes 62 s q km.
(e)
 
The area of the exp anded Philadelphi corridor amounts to 10.8 s q km.
49
2˜
Pat tern ˚n dings
2
 
Israel™s military camp aign in Gaza bet ween 7 October 2023 and 30 June 2024 involved the reshaping 
of the cultivated and built environment of the region through a cts of 
destruction
 and 
construction
. 
Large tracts of territory were cleared, in cludin g agricultural areas an d buildin gs. In th eir place, the 
Israeli military constructed roads, temporary encampments, permanent bas es, lines of forti˚cation, and  
checkpoints. Our analysis found that thes e acts of destruction and construction were not haphazard, 
but followed consistent and clear sp atial logic:
2.1
 
All agricultural ˛elds, orchards, greenhouses, and other agriculture where the bu˜er zone, the 
corridors, and the raid routes were established have been destroyed. The construction of these 
new infrastructural elements has likely contaminated the soil, inhibiting future use (see Chapter 4:"
Destruction of Agriculture and Water Resources,,"). 
2.2
 
The Netzarim corridor divides Gaza into two ‚zones™: 
(a)
 
The ‚north™, from which Israel ordered the evacuation of civilians
(b)
 
The ‚south™, which include s ‚destination are as™ (see Section A (Glo s sary) in Chapter 3:"
Displacement,,") 
2.3
 
These zones are separated by checkpoints where Gaza™s main nor thŒsouth roads cross the 
Netzarim corridor.
2.4
 
The Netzarim corridor and the checkpoints facilitate"
Displacement,,displacement
Displacement,,": 
(a)
 
Movement bet ween the zones mentioned is restricted and controlled by checkpoints. 
(b)
 
The checkpoints exclusively allow for one-way movement by civilians from the north to the 
s outh (s ee Chapter 3:"
Displacement,,") and aid from ‚s outh™ to ‚north™ (s ee Chapter 7: Targeting 
of  A id).
2.5
 
Thirteen raid routes lead from the perimeter to the interior of Gaza. These routes facilitated 
repeated military incursions, and the extent of work invested in their construction suggests they 
may have long-term presence and be fur ther employed for this purpose.
2.6
 
The majority of buildings in areas where the bu˜er zone, the corridors, and the raid routes were 
established have been destroyed.
2.7
 
The territorial reorganisation of Gaza is consistent with statements made by Israeli political 
leaders calling for a long-term Israeli military presence and the construction of permanent Jewish 
settlements in Gaza.

BACKGROUND
3
 
In 196 7, Israel occupied Gaza. In the early 1970s, it conducted a counter-insurgency camp aign there. 
A matrix of physical structures was built, including s ettlements, roads, military bases, and checkpoints  
acro ss Gaza. In 2005, Israel removed and de stroyed it s military base s an d illegal settlement s f rom Gaza  
and redeployed its military behind the established cease˚re line. More forti˚cations were constructed 
around the p erimeter of Gaza: new fences, ramparts , ba ses, and electronic surveillance systems. 
De spite th e 2005 I sraeli ‚evacuation™ of Gaza, international organisations such as the Red Cros s, th e UN,  
the European Union, the African Union, as well as international courts and human rights organisations 
s till co nside r Gaz a an oc cupied te rritor y. This is becau se Is rael has ‚e˜ec tive co ntro l™ over the lives 
of Pales tinians in Gaz a throu gh i ts do mination of access to the enclave v ia land crossings, the sea, 
and its air sp ace.

The Israeli ground o˜ensive in Gaza that starte d on 27 October 2023 involved the installation of a 
new sp atial system of territorial control. This new system repeats patterns of conduct and control 
establi shed during the period of Israel™s dire ct occup ation of Gaza bet ween 196 7˝200 5. The system of  
sp atial control which has emerged since October 2023 is compos ed of s everal elements. This chapter  
examines and analys es the elements that constitute this system, and the relation bet ween them. 
Further chapters will pres ent how thes e attacks have been conducted in relation to the imposition of 
this sp atial system. 
C˜
SCOPE
5
 
In this chapter, we examine how the territory of Gaza has been reshaped by acts of destruction and 
construction bet ween 7 October 2023 and 30 June 2024. It lays the ground for subs equent chapters 
by pres enting the sp atial system within which the incidents they describe take place.

Our analysis examines the following:
(a)
 
The territory of Gaza has been reshaped by acts of destruction and construction bet ween 7

NOTES FOR GEOGRAPHIC ORIENTATION
7
 
In the ˚rst week of its military camp aign, Israel ordered Palestinians to evacuate s outh of Wadi Gaza, 
which thereafter divided Gaza into a new ‚north™ and ‚south™. From early November, this separation 
crystallised into an internal border ro ughly two kilometres north of Wadi Gaza, known as the ‚Netzarim  
corridor ™. While p arts of Gaza s outh of this line are often referred to as the ‚s outh™, this area includes 
both the ‚centre™ of Gaza Œ an area around Deir al-Balah and the refugee camps of Nus eirat, A l-Bureij, 
and A l-Maghazi Œ and the areas in the s outh around Khan Younis, A l-Mawasi, and Rafah.
8
 
Salah al-Din Road, running northŒs outh, divides Gaza into east and west. The western area along the 
coast is largely compos ed of sand dunes, while the east is an area of agriculturally fertile agrarian s oil 
called loess, as well as sedimented clay. Al-Rashid Road r uns north to south between Salah al-Din 
Road and the coast.

TIMELINE
1˜
First three weeks (bombing campaign): October 2023
13
 
Israel™s military camp aign in Gaza, starting in October 2023, began with heavy aerial bombardment 
of Gaza™s built-up, urban areas (s ee Chapter 6:"
Destruction of Civilian Infrastructure,,").
 
On 13 October, 
Israel ordered the 1.1 million re sident s of G aza City and it s surrounding camp s and village s to le ave 
their homes within 24 hours and move s outh of Wadi Gaza. 
On 21 October 2023, the Israeli military™s 
Coo rdinator of Gover nm e nt Ac tiv ities in the Te r r i to ries (COGAT) announced throu gh Face bo o k: ‚Anyone  
who is within 1000 metres of the s ecurit y fence is putting his life in danger ™.

2˜
Groun d invasion of north of Gaza: October 2023
14
 
T he Israeli military ™s ground invas ion, which began on 27 October, progressed along two m ain 
throughlines, enveloping G aza Cit y and its surroundings. One of the invasion routes progress ed from 
north to sou th along the coa stal al-Ra shid Road. The other route created an eastŒwes t wed ge just 
north of Wadi Gaza in an area that later became the Netzarim corridor. 
15
 
Shortly after the invasion began, a large encampm ent ma de of earth berms was established along 
each of the military routes. Along the northern coastal route, a military encampment was built over the 
ancient archaeological site of A nthedon. Military bulldozers rais ed multiple earth berms, destroying 
archaeologically rich s oil.
4
16
 
By 31 October, the Israeli military had gained control of the area of the former Netzarim s ettlement.
5
 
By 6 November, it had reached the coast, closing o˜ Gaza Cit y from the s outh. 
Satellite  images  from  
30 Novemb er con˚rmed the pres ence of earth berms around the TurkishŒPalestinian Friendship 
Hospital (henceforth ‚the Turkish Hospital™)
 
north of Wadi Gaza. The hospital was built on the site of 
the former s ettlement of Netzarim (s ee Chapter 1:"
Introduction,,").

During this period the Israeli military consolidated control of the area that would become the Netzarim  
corridor and extended the temporary irregular corridor from the eastern perimeter of Gaza to the coa st.  
4˜
Ground invasion begins in the south: December 2023
18
 
Our analys is shows further destruction of buildings and ˜elds within the bu˚er zone along Gaza™s 
p e rimeter. In the north, the des truction took p lace east of the refug ee camps of Jabalia and S huja™iyya; 
in the centre, it was most clearly detected bet ween Deir al-Balah and the perimeter along Wadi Gaza.

The occupation of Khan Younis: December 2023 ŒFebruary 2024
19
 
On 5 Decembe r 2023 , the Isra eli militar y began its invasion of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah.
 
In 
central Gaza, agricultural and domestic areas east of al-Bureij and al-Maghazi refugee camps were 
razed between late December 2023 and January 2024 (see Chapter 4: Destruction of Agr iculture 
and Water Resources).

Military campaign in the south deepens: FebruaryŒMarch 2024
20
 
Buildin gs an d agricultural land were destroyed alon g th e expan ded b u˚er zon e in th e so uth eastern 
perimeter of the Gaza b etween Khan Youni s and Rafah. Further destruction was vi sible along the 
northern perimeter of Gaza and in areas along the bu˚er zone s outh of Gaza Cit y. The construction 
of the Netzarim corridor be came visible on satellite images in February. The main road in that corridor 
was surrounded by a deep bu˚er zone in which every building or agricultural facilit y was destroyed.

Our analysis s hows the d es tru c tio n of larg e swathes of agricultural land and buil dings no rth and sou th  
of the Netzar im corridor near Deir Al-Balah. During the second and third weeks of May, the Isra eli 
military began the creation of a raid route east of Jabaliya.

Ground invasion of Rafah: MayŒJune 2024
22
 
Th e de struction of structure s an d agric ultural land durin g this time cre ated wide margins along the raid  
routes. During May, further land clearings and earthworks were undertaken in the Netzarim corridor, 
including the addition of asphalt to more p arts of the road and the exp ansion of military bas es.

Bu˝er zone
23
 
In September 200 5, when Israel evacuated its s ettlements and bas es from Gaza, the military ordered 
residents to keep a distance of at least 150 m from the perimeter fence, though in practice, restrictions 
extended to 500 m from the fence.
6
 Israel enforced the bu˜er zone using live ˚re. After Hamas took 
power in 2007, Israel o˜iciall y restricte d access 300 m from the fence, though in some areas this 
extended to 1 kilometre. From 2010 onwards, while formally the bu˜er zone was s et at 300 m, farmers 
were allowed to approach up to 100 m from the fence. Israeli military bulldozers would invade Gaza 
and ˘atten are as within the bu˜er zone regularly. In 20 19, rese arch s uggeste d that Israel was using 
bulldozers and the aerial spraying of herbicide to destroy crops in the bu˜er zone.
7
24
 
On 21 October 2023, the Israeli military announced, ‚A nyone who is within 1,000 metres of the s e curity  
fence is putting their life in danger ™.

1000 metres of the security fence i s putting his life in danger™. [Incident ID: M4102115028] Soon after thi s warning, I srael™s 
military began expanding t he bu˜er zone. Our analysis suggests t hat t he bu˜er zone in s ome places reaches up to 2 kilomet res 
from the fence line.
25
 
While the previous 300m bu˜er zone amounte d to a total are a of 18 sq km , our analysi s shows that 
the total area destroyed for the expanded bu˜er zone (including its previous extent) amounted to 55 
s q  km  of  mainly  agricultural  lands.

Starting in ear ly 2024, almos t eve r y s tru c ture w i thin the bu˜er zo ne was razed to the ground. This 
included neighbourhoods (such as Shuja™iyya, s ee Figure 4), villages (such as Khuza™a, Khirbat Ikhza™a, 
and Al Sureij), hom es, schools, and m osques. Alm ost all a gricultural ˚e lds, orc hards, and greenhouses  
in this zone were likewis e destroyed.

 The buil ding rubbl e a nd the agricul t ural

lan dscape of high an d long berms, en closures, an d hill s, which al so created barriers, hideouts, and 
forti˚cations  for  Israeli  s oldiers.
28
 
The bu˜er zone is a military zone. Palestinians are prohib ited from enter ing it and civilians trying to 
approach it have been shot at. Routes and roads leading into and towards the bu˜er zone have been 
clos ed o˜, often with earth berms.

T he declared bu˜er zone includes 58 sq km
 
of mainly agricultura l land, constituting about 16% of 
Gaza . Th e construction of th e bu˜er zon e displaced tens of thousands of civilians. Given that the 
eastern p art of Gaza has the most fertile s oil, and that most of its agricultural sector is located there, 
the creation of the bu˜er zone s everely imp acted Gaza™s food production.
31
 
The damage to agriculture in the bu˜er zone was not limited to the destroyed surface but extended 
to the contamination of the ground beneath. 
The destruction and pulverising of built structures in the 
bu˜er zone releas ed chemicals, metals, ˚re contaminants, explosive residue, unexploded ordnance, 
and othe r hazardous subs tances s peci˚c to clinics, labo rato r ies, and industrial si tes. In Gaz a, as bes tos  
is still pres ent in older buildings and in refugee camps. Many of thes e hazardous substances may take 
s everal years to decay and thereby negatively a˜ect the s oil and groundwater for decades. It is als o 
possible that human remains are buried in this vast quantit y of building debris.
32
 
T he destruction of buildings also released wastewater out of damaged pipes . T he soil has been further  
contaminated with oil and petrol releas ed from military vehicles. The destruction of irrigation systems 
and the move ment of heav y mili tar y ve hicl es c o mpress the soil and limi t i ts abili ty to abso r b wate r, 
destroying its abilit y to renew its elf.
10
 
33
 
The exp anded bu˜er zone correlates with statements made by Israeli political leaders. For example, 
on 18 October 2023, Israel™s then foreign minister Eli C ohen said: ‚At the end of this war, not only will 
Hamas no longer be in Gaza, but the territory of Gaza will als o decreas e.™
11
3 4
 
On 1 September 2024, ˚nan ce minister Bezalel Smotrich declared his support for the furth er expans ion  
of the bu˜er zone and for making it a permanent ˚xture. ‚T his morning the Gaza Strip must be reduced.  
IDF forces should move two kilometres inland from the current border and clear everything in their 
way. This is a territory that will never be returned to the Gazans.™

The ‚Netzarim corridor™
Figure 
 
2.10 . 
Civili ans evacuating from no rth to south Gaz a were r eq uired to cross mili ta ry checkpoints on al-Ra shid or Sala h 
al-Din Ro ads. Unt il t he beginning of 2024 t hes e were tempor ary checkpo ints. 
35
 
The location of the N etzar im corridor corresponds to one of the ˚rst areas inva ded by the Israeli 
military. Starting on 2 9 October 2023, the military moved into this s ector from east to west. As of the 
time of pub lication, th e I sraeli military has n ot left this are a. Th e corridor, which bisect s Gaza, was 
created gradually. It is lo c ated two kilo metres no rth of and parall el to Wadi Gaz a and cuts o˜ Gaz a 
Cit y from the rest of Gaza. 
67
 
Figure 
 
2.11. 
Satellite image from 30 November 2023 shows the signature of a new irregul ar route (in red) enveloped by new 
eart h berms (in yellow).
36
 
We us ed satellite imagery from 30 November 2023 to map a new irregular route being built north of 
Wadi Gaza (
Figure  
 
2.11
). In satellite imagery from 20 March 2024, we detected a new road Œ straight 
and wide Œ along the same orientation, approximately 0. 5km s outh of the previous route (
Figure  
 
2.12
).
68
37
 
It appears to have b e en con structe d as a permanent road. The ground was pressed by he avy compactors  
and p aved with a layer of asphalt (
Figure  
 
2.20
). What was colloquially known as the Netzarim corridor 
received an o˜ icial road name Œ Route 749 Œ in keeping with Israel™s tra˜ic system, suggesting a 
longer-term intention that it be integrated into this existing system. The military placed ˘ags along the 
road and s oldiers reportedly refer to it as ‚the blue and white Netzarim route™.
13
 Since its p aving, the 
road has enabled military vehicles to travel along it at high speeds, with large supply trucks providing 
for the bas es and checkpoints created along it. The Israe li military has als o installed obs ervation and 
communication towers all along the road.
14
38
 
On both sides of the road, we identi˚ed that the military had created earth berms a few metres high 
to protect the road from being obs erved from the surrounding 
areas 
or targeted by sniper
s
.
 
39
 
Satellite imagery from mid-August shows large-scale destruction on both sides of the road. Destruction  
of all agricultural infrastructure and most buildings extended for about 2 to 3. 5
km
 on the s outh side 
and 1.7 to 3. 5
km
 on the north. On each side of the berms, the military destroyed all existing structures, 
except for a few buildings requisitioned and appropriated by its units. It also uprooted all the agriculture  
in  
this area, following similar p atterns to the destruction enacted in the bu˜er zone (

Sate ll ite i ma ge from 26 Augu st 20 24 showi ng the new Netzar i m roa d and the i rregular route (both i n red) enve loped 
by eart h berms (in yellow). New infr ast ructure along t he Net zarim corridor includes four military bas es and a caus eway for t he 
US ˘oating pier.
70
40
 
We us ed before-and-after analysis to identify the destroyed structures. Several public buildings and 
other infrastructure, including t wo parks, ˚ve universities and universit y campuses (including the al-
Isra a University, the al-Ummah University, the University of Palestine, the fa culty of m edicine of the 
Islamic University of Gaza, and the faculty of law of al-Azhar University), a courthouse (see Chapter 
6: The Destruction of Infrastructure), a wastewater treatment facilit y, and the ‚Turk ish hospital™ were 
located in this area. All building s but the Turk ish hospital, which becam e a military headquarters, were 
destroyed (
Figure  
 
2.13
, 
Figure  
 
2.14
).
41
 
We calculated that the total area destroyed for the road and the cleared zone around it was 35 s q km 
by August 2024 Œ constituting 9.6% of Gaza.
42
 
Palestinians are forbidden from entering or crossing this zone, except along t wo roads, Salah al-Din 
Road and al-Rashid Road, which lead to checkpoints where they inters ect with the Netzarim corridor. 
Thes e checkpoints are equipped with remotely controlled biometric s ens ors. 
43
 
We identi˚ed four Israeli military bas es built along the Netzarim corridor (
Figure  
 
2.12
). The ‚eastern 
bas e™ was built around a former school building in the destroyed village of Juhor ad-Dik. The ‚central 
base™ wa s built w here the Netz arim cor rid or inter sects w ith Salah al-Din Road, also the si te of an 
aforementioned checkpoint (
Figure  
 
2.20
).
44
 
The Turkish hospital bas e is built in and around the requisitioned hospital. 
45
 
The ‚western base™, where the Netzarim corridor inters ects the al-Rashid Road, is the s econd of the 
t wo major checkpoints. 
46
 
Satelli te and ground imag es reveal paved sur faces, p refabric ated, air-c o ndi tio ned housing uni ts fo r 
the s oldiers, showers and bathrooms, tall antennas, as well as power infrastructure, communications 
towers , electricity, and lights .
15
 Protruding past the shoreline as if to continue the road into the sea 
was a causeway leading to the ‚˘ oating pier™ built by the US military in April to May 2024 . This pier 
was dismantled in July 2024.
 
The Netzarim corridor hous ed the logistical heart of the Israeli military 
and its p artners.
 
The border, the pier, and the checkpoints compris e a single logistical complex .
47
 
The corridor acts as a launchp ad for military operations in Gaza. It is also creating a permanent internal  
border through Gaza, one through which the military can control the movement of Palestinians.

We have d ocumented over 3 0 incidents in the per iod between Januar y and March 2024 whe re civilians  
s eeking aid have been killed within the margins of the Netzarim corridor (s ee Chapter 7: Targeting of 
A id for incidents of targeting civilians s eeking aid along the Netzarim corridor).

Many members of the Israeli government, a s well a s other p oliticians, cultural ˚ gures, and soldiers, 
have advocated for a long-term military pres ence and the establishment of s ettlements in the area.

Checkpoints˙

In addition to the two che ckpoint s where the Netzarim corridor intersect s with Gaza™s two main 
northŒsouth arteries, we identi˚ed several temporary c hec k points operation al at di˜erent times in 
di˜erent p arts of Gaza bet ween November 2023 and February 2024.

Earth berms, surveillance cameras and speakers are am ong the de˚ning spatial features of these 
checkpoints. The surveillance cameras were us ed for facial recognition.
18
 Displaced civilians passing 
through them were instructed to hold up their IDs and make their fac es visible to the cameras (see

).

Permanent checkpoints
52
 
The t wo main checkpoints, and s ome of the temporary ones, are equipped with a facial-recognition 
system (s ee  
Figure  
 
2.24
, 
Figure  
 
2.2 9
)  connected  to  a  large  databas e  of  photographic  and  biometric  
data.
19
 As a result, Palestinians passing through these checkpoints have their faces scanned and 
movements registered without their consent. Facial-recognition systems were already installed prior to 
October 2023 in th e terminals at the Erez an d Rafah crossings. At many of the temporary checkpoints,  
s ome unmanned, we identi˚ed cameras mounted on tripods that were situated on nearby earth berms.

53
 
From March 2024, the checkpoints along the new Netzarim corridor managed the ˘ow of aid trucks 
northward from Rafah (s ee Chapter 7: Targeting of A id). A id convoys that made the risky northbound 
journey from Rafah to Netzarim were stopped and delayed at these c hec k points, one of s everal means  
by which the Israeli military was in control of the ˘ow of aid.
20
 
5 4
 
These checkpoints were referred to as ‚drains™.
21
 T he ‚drains™ were equipped with megaphones and 
s urveillance cameras. While soldiers  were positione d  around  the checkpoints, the  che ckpoints 
thems elves appeared to operate automatically (
Figure  
 
2.25
).  
55
 
It is unclear what information is being collected, but a reported case of a civilian passing through a 
‚drain™ being recognised by soldiers witho ut having shown their ID suggests that surveillance cameras  
at checkpoints are connected to a databas e gathering intelligence about the Palestinian population.

‚Raid routes™
63
 
Our anal ysis of sequential satellite imagery since October 2023 has identi˚e d thir teen ‚raid routes™ 
le ading from roads and military bases out side of Gaza to facilitate raids deep within th e territory (
Figure 
 
2.34
). Some of thes e routes were newly formed, but many were revivals of routes that had b een us ed 
during the period of Israel™s o˜icial occup ation of the Gaza Strip (
Figure  
 
2.35
).  
6 4
 
Thes e routes facilitated military incursions and were often us ed more than once (s ee 
Figure  
 
2.43
, s ee 
Chapter 8: Cross Patterns, 
Figure   8.9
).  
Their construction Œ or where relevant the widening of those 
that already existed Œ involved the destruction of all structures and agriculture within a wide margin 
on either side
. 
65
 
The Israeli military destroye d structures located up to 500m on each side of these routes. On b oth 
s ides of the routes, we identi ˚ed earth berms for military encampments (
Figure 
 
2 .37
, 
Figure 
 
2.40
, 
Figure 
 
2.41
) T hese berms are often created using agricultural soil or the rubble of buildings the military 
demolished.
 
Often the raid routes lead to S alah al-Din Road, poss ibly to facilitate the creation of 
temporary  checkpoints  to  block  tra˜ic.

The Netzarim corridor, the Philadelphi corridor, the clearings around the raid routes and the bu˜er 
zone together constitute, according to our calculations, 131.7 s q km or 36% of the total area of Gaza.
68
 
Moving along the raid routes, the Israeli military established control over Salah al-Din and al-Rashid 
Roads, the t wo main northŒsouth tra˜ic arteries in Gaza. The Israeli military has blocked p arts of thes e  
roads on multiple occasions (s ee 
Figure

).

Our analysis points to a c o r relatio n betwee n the path of raid rou tes and Israeli ground inva sio n 
throughout the period bet ween December 2023 and June 2024. The newly established raid routes 
were u sed to fa cilitate repeated round s of invasions of built-up Palestinian areas (see

).

Berms
7 0
 
In areas it invaded, the Israeli military frequently rais ed earth berms. Thes e result from the landscaping  
of an are a using milit ary bulldozers to cre ate raised mounds made of soil or building r ubb le. The berms  
create lines of separation or forti˚cation. They are m ainly located along the raid routes , within the 
bu˜er zone, and along the Netzarim corridor. 
71
 
Some are stretched linearly along the roads , poss ibly for obscuring vehicles travelling along them . 
Other s are laid ou t as s mall e ncl osures fo r mili tar y enc amp me nts o r are used to channel tra˜ic throu gh 
temporary checkpoints. 
72
 
In raising the berms, bulldozer operators us e both s oil and building rubble. The us e of s oil negatively 
alters the agricultural surface. 
73
 
Some de stroye d buildings in the cities and camps are spray-painte d with the name s of pe ople presumed  
missing (
Figure  
 
2.47
). Still, before any recovery work is undertaken, and without permission or notice, 
this rubble has been us ed as building material by the Israeli military for the creation of earth berms. 
74
 
We have als o identi˚ed instances where the Israeli military dug up areas that contained cemeteries 
to obtain extra dirt to pile onto earth berms (

Philadelphi corridor
75
 
T he Philadelphi corridor runs along the international border between Gaza and Egypt. Before October 
2023, the area destroyed by the Israeli military on the Gazan side of the Philade lphi corridor extended 
to 100 m (
Figure  
 
2.49
).
76
 
Data published by ISW shows that the Philadelphi corridor was not invaded for the ˚rst eight months 
of hostilities and was onl y seize d by the Israeli military in May 2024. According to our calculation s 
Israel extended the bu˜er zone along this corridor to a width of up to 450 m from the border by June 
2024  (

This chapter examines the ‚prote ctive meas ures™ put in place by the Israeli military, including warnings,  
evacuation orders, ‚safe routes™, ‚humanitarian zones™, and their imp act on Gaza™s civilian population.

A˜
GLOSSARY
2
 
‚Evacuation order™
: a communication issued by the Israeli military ordering civilians to evacuate a 
particular area. An evacuation o rd e r c an be c o mmunic ated by airdro pped l ea˘ets, posts o n so cial 
media (most often X or Facebook), phone calls, text messages, or by loudspeaker.
3
 
‚Evacuation  grid™
: a map published by the Israeli military on 1 December 2023 dividing Gaza into more 
than 600 irregularly shaped blocks, each with its own assigned number. The military has thereafter 
us ed this map to designate ‚evacuation areas™ and ‚destination areas™ by referencing the numbers on 
the block (see below).
4
 
‚Evacuation  areas™
: areas from which civilians are ordered to leave via evacuation orders.
5
 
‚Destina tion areas™
: areas to which the Israeli military has ordered civilians to move from evacuation 
areas;  this  includes  blocks  within  the  ‚evacuation  grid™  and  the  Israeli- designated  ‚humanitarian  zone™.  
6
 
‚Humanitarian zone™
: an are a designate d by the Israeli military as safe from military incursion, with 
access to humanitarian aid. The Israeli military has als o referred to this area as the ‚humanitarian area.™
7
 
‚Unde˚ne d area s™
: areas without a clear status; they have neither b e en designate d as evacuation 
areas nor destination areas. This is not a term used by the Israeli military but rather one we are using 
to refer to this category of area.
8
 
‚Evacuation arrows™
: graphic arrows used in the map s attached to the evac uation orders iss ued by 
the Israeli military. Thes e annotations are us ed by the Israeli military to direct civilians from evacuation 
areas to destination areas. This is not a term us ed by the Israe li military but rather one we are using 
to  refer to  this  annotation.
B˜
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
1˜
Quantitative ˚n dings
1.1
 
The territory including destination areas and the ‚humanitarian zone™ shrank over time:
(a)
 
On 13 O ctober 2023, this area included all of Gaza south of Wadi Gaza and covered 228 .2 
s q km (62. 5%) of the total territory of Gaza.
(b)
 
On 7 January 2024, it included Rafah, Deir al-Balah and the al-Mawasi ‚humanitarian zone™, 
covering 80.7 s q km (22.1%) of Gaza.
(c)
 
On 6 May 2024, it shrank to include onl y the newl y estab li she d ‚expande d humanitarian zone™,  
covering 60.9 s q km (16.6%) of Gaza.
(d )
 
On 16 August 2024, the ‚humanitarian zone™ contracted. The area covers 37.9 s q km (10.4%) 
of  Gaza.
(e)
 
On 30 August 2024, three blocks have been reintegrated to the ‚expanded humanitarian 
zone™, exp anding its extent to covering 47.4 s q km (13%) of Gaza.
118
(f)
 
The boundaries of the ‚humanitarian zone™ established from 18 Octob er 2023 changed 9 
times by 30 August 2024.
1.2
 
Between 7 October 2023 and 31 August 2024, 84% of Gaza™s total area was subject to evacuation 
orders. 
(a)
 
The 13 October evacuation order covered 37% of the total area of Gaza.
(b)
 
After the grid-bas ed evacuation orders were introduced on 1 December, most areas in Gaza 
were ordered to evacuate at least once. B et ween 1 December 2023 and 31 August 2024, 72 
percent of Gaza™s total area was subject to evacuation orders.
(c)
 
By 6 May, only 6.9 percent (25.3 s q km) of areas in Gaza, excluding the area of the ‚humanitarian  
zone™, had not received an evacuation order yet. 
(d )
 
A total of 66 evacuation orders were issued bet ween 7 October 2023 and 31 August 2024. 
Most orders refer to multiple blocks at a time. 
(e)
 
According to data publi she d by the UN, 346 schools were use d as shelters, 70% of them 
were attacked.

BACKGROUND
10
 
Over the past two decades the Israe li military has been using phone calls, text messages, social media  
po sts, airdropped le a˘et s, and announc ement s communicated on loudspe akers (sometime s on drone s)  
to warn c i vilians of impending attacks and order them to evac uate an area. Often, the military has 
us ed ‚roof knock™ strikes, which involve the ˚ring of a low- explosive missile Œ usually from a drone Œ in 
proximity of c ivilian s, at stre et level or at the roof of a building that i s s ubse quentl y to be destroye d. 
S ome of th ese warnings have given res idents just a few minutes to collect their belongings and vacate  
a hous e, a building, or an institution before it was bombed. Since the 2008˝09 Israeli attack on Gaza, 
the us e of warnings has been scaled up to encapsulate larger neighbourhoods.
2
 
1 1
 
A well-communicated ‚ warning™ can be a protective measure, but the system is a double -edged 
sword. The Israeli military argues that if residents are warned and do not evacuate, the responsibilit y 
for their safety no longer rests with the military, ultim ately eroding the distinction between civilians 
and  combatants.
3
 
1 2
 
This lack of critical distinction has become increasingly problematic as it has become more and more 
di˜icult for ci vilians to keep up with the evol ving evacuation, de stination, and ‚humanitarian zones™. Sinc e  
Oc to be r 2023 , the Is raeli mili tary has issued ‚evacuatio n o rd e r s™ wi th su ch frequ e ncy, and c ove ring 
suc h large areas of Gaza, that a great majority of Gaza™s population has been displaced, often from one  
unsafe area to the next, without guarantees of safet y or access to infrastructure essential for survival.

METHODOLOGY 
1˜
Evacuation orders
14
 
To document evacuation orders (among other announcements made by the Israeli military), we collected  
information from online pro˚les and plat forms to which thos e orders were posted, including:
(a)
 
the X/Tw i tte r ac c ount of Lt. Co l. Av ichay Adra ee, Arabic -languag e s po kespe r so n fo r the 
Israeli  military
7
(b)
 
the Face bo ok ac c ount of the Is raeli mili tar y™s Coo rdinatio n of Gove r nme nt Ac tiv i ties in the 
Territories (COGAT)
8
15
 
We downloaded the evacuation grid dataset from a webpage run by the Israeli military.
9
 From that 
data, we created three cartographic datas ets within the GCD, in GeoJSON format:
10
1.1
 
A dataset for ‚evacuation orders™ that used the evacuation grid system. 
16
 
We tagged any ‚block™ (i.e. one of more than 600 sub-regions of Gaza de˚ned by the ‚evacuation 
grid™) referred to in an evacuation order with the date corresponding to that order. If an evacuation 
order was annotated with arrows suggesting the direction of movement/evacuation, we traced thes e 
arrows and added them to the datas et. We then tagged each dated block according to whether it in 
fact fell within the area de˚ned by the given evacuation order, with one of the three following tags: 
(a)
 
If the block in question was highlighted in a map but not speci˚ed in the text description of 
the map (i.e. whether the order was internally inconsistent)
(b)
 
If the block in question was speci˚ed in the text description of the order, but not highlighted 
on the map its elf (again, whether the order was internally inconsistent)
(c)
 
If the block in question was highlighted fully, or only p artially in the order
1.2
 
A dataset for ‚evacuation orders™ that did not use the evacuation grid system
.
17
 
The bound ed regio ns we re e nte red into the dataset , annotated w i th the dates 
o n w hich they were 
highlighted for evac uation, and the date on which that region was announc e d as subj ect to an evac uation  
order. 
18
 
A data set was created for names of places (e.g., ‚Deir al-Balah™) speci˚ed in evacuation orders that 
did not have clearly m arked bo undaries or corresponding numbered blocks. If an evacuation order 
was annotated with arrows suggesting the direction of m ovem ent/eva cuation, we tra ced these arrows  
and added them to the datas et.

Extent of the groun d invasion
20
 
Our ground invasion data draws on cartographic reports published by the Institute for the Study of 
War (ISW) an d th e Critical Threats Project (CTP) at th e American Enterprise Institute, which maps 
the geographic progression and extent of Israel™s ground invasion day-by- day, bas ed on third-p art y 
sourc es from 27 October 2023 onwards. We integrated two categories of dat a that CTPISW has 
mapped: ‚R eported Israeli Clearing Operations™ and ‚Claimed Furthest Israeli Advances™ in o ur research.  
We process ed and mapped this data suc h that, for eac h report re leased, we could see and assess 
the furthest extent of the ground invasion to that date (in ˚gure legends throughout: Ground invasion) 
as well as the chang e in the exte nt of the ground invasio n since the p receding re po rt (in ˚gure 
legends thro ughout: Gro und invas ion recent). O n 10 May 2024, CTPISW recessed their Israeli clearing  
operations layer in Gaza to cover only the areas in which the Israeli military was actively conducting 
clearing operations.
 
This change in methodology is re˘ected in all data entries from 10 May onwards.

ELEMENTS WHICH IMPACT CIVILIAN DISPL ACEMENT

T he following is an extended explanation of the primary elements that have shaped civilian"
Destruction of Medical Infrastructure,,displacement
Destruction of Medical Infrastructure,,"across Gaza since October 2023.
1˜
Evacuation orders
25
 
S ince October 2023, the Israeli military has used airdroppe d lea˘ets and posts on soc ial me dia to 
instruct residents of various areas of Gaza to evacuate from evacuation areas towards designated 
‚destination  areas™.
26
 
Other methods have reportedly included phone calls, text messages, and drone-m ounted loudspeakers.
14
 
Instructions have at times included designated ‚safe routes™ (s ee below), and information to the e˜ect 
that any civilians remaining in the ‚evacuation area™ are at risk of physical harm or death. 
27
 
A ll evacuation orders recorded in our datas et are listed in the"
Destruction of Medical Infrastructure,,appendix
Destruction of Medical Infrastructure,,"to this chapter.

On 1 December 2023, the Israeli military published a web -b ased interactive m ap that divided Gaza into 
over six hundred numbered blocks.

 The map was pres ented as a tool to inform Palestinian civilians 
which areas were being ordered to evacuate, and to identify destination areas to relocate to: ‚a safe

Destination 
areas
30
 
A long with the evacuation orders, Israeli o˜icials announced areas across south Gaza where people 
should go ‚for their own safet y™.
31
 
Th e boundaries of what we call destination are as have often n ot been e˜ecti vely communicated, either  
verbally or visually. The following is a list of all declared destination areas recorded in our datas et:
3.1
 
13 October 2023˚1 December 2023: Palestinians were instructed to move south of Wadi Gaza. 
3.2
 
After 1 December, as areas south of Wadi Gaza began receiving evacuation orders, the Israeli 
military continued urging Palestinians to go to the ‚humanitarian zone™ in al-Mawasi, in addition to 
the destination areas of Rafah and Deir al-Balah. 
32
 
Starting from the ˚rst ‚evacuation order ™ directed to Khan Younis in the s outh on 2 December 2023, 
the Israeli military in structe d Pale stinians to evac uate to Rafah. In some of the se orders, they in structed  
Palestinians to evacuate to ‚known shelters™ in some neighbourhoo ds in R afah. [Map ID: M
-3121394253
]
33
 
Starting from 22 December 2023, the Israeli military instructed Palestinians to go to shelters in Deir 
al-Balah, again without specifying a speci˚c boundary of an area there. On one occasion the military 
dropped a lea˘et that highlighted blocks in the evacuation grid in Deir al-Balah, indicating that people 
should move there for ‚their safet y™ (s ee 
Figure   3. 5
).

Th e al-Mawasi area exempli ˚es the ambiguous an d elastic nature of th e bo un daries assigned to

35
 
A l-Mawasi is a region along the coast of Gaza, west of Khan Younis. On 18 October 2023, the Israeli 
military ma de their ˚rst p ublic reference to the al-Mawasi ‚humanitarian zone™.
17
 [Map ID: M31 018 -
68 118]
18
 
36
 
On 28 A pril 2024, the Israeli military announced in English, and then again on 6 May in A rabic, that 
the al-Mawasi ‚humanitarian zone™ was to be exp anded into areas to the north of the original ‚zone™. At 
the same time, this ‚exp anded humanitarian zone™ now excluded areas to the s outh, which had been 
included in the original ‚humanitarian zone™ (as published on 6 December 2023).
19
37
 
By 6 May 2024, when the Israeli military b egan its invasion of Rafah and ordere d the evacuation of 
Palestinian civilians from there  to the ‚expanded humanitarian zone™ in al-Mawasi, the boundaries of the  
area had already bee n al te red at l eas t three times. Since 6 May, six di˜e re nt ve r sio ns of the boundaries  
of the al-Mawasi ‚expanded hum anitarian zon e™ have been published. [Map IDs: M4050611366, 
M4072247808, M4072715438, M4081140811, M4081640816, M408302343 6]
5˜
‚Safe Routes™
38
 
Some Israeli evacuation orders have als o de˚ned ‚safe™ relocation routes for civilians travelling from 
areas subject to evacuation orders to destination areas. Safe routes have reportedly been attac ked 
since as early as 13 October 2023.
20
39
 
On 13 and 14 October 2023, following the 13 October evacuation order, the Israeli military posted 
a map on Facebook indicating two ‚safe route s™ for evacuation from northern G aza. The route s ran 
along Salah al-Din Road and al-Rashid Road, the two m ain roads running northŒsouth thro ugh Gaza .
21
 
 
These two routes have also subsequently been referred to as ‚safe routes™ and ‚humanitarian corridors™  
(s ee  
Figure   3.7

Shelters 
41
 
Many scho ols and hos pi tals in Gaza have ac ted a s shelter s fo r dis p laced civilians (see Chapter 2:"
Spatial Control,,"). According to data pub lished by the UN in July, 34 6 schools were used as shelters 
(s ee  
Figure   3.9
). 70 % of thes e were attacked, 30 were destroyed and 214 damaged.
23
42
 
A longside destination areas, many evacuation orders by the Israeli military have instructed civilians to 
relocate to ‚well-known shelter points™, such as school building s. ‚Shelters™ in this context are supposed  
to refer to buildings in Gaza that the Israeli military has agreed not to target and has designated safe 
for civilians. However, the Israeli evacuation orders did not specify which schools were protected.
43
 
Numerous orders release d by the Israeli military, including the order f rom 2 De cemb er 2023, in structe d  
civilians to evacuate to unspeci˚ed ‚known shelters™ and ‚schools™ in various regions. Such orders 
assume that all civilians are aware of the location of thes e shelter points (s ee 
Figure   3.10
).

Whil e the Is raeli militar y has d esignated many ˘u c tuating evacuatio n and d esignatio n areas since 
Octob er, some par ts of G aza were never describ ed as one or the other. This report refers to the se 
areas as ‚unde˚ned areas™. Our analysis shows that Palestinian civilians were attacked in these areas 
despite never having been ordered to evacuate from them.

The ˚rst evacuation orders, issued on 7 October 2023, related to four neighbourhoods across Gaza 
(s ee 
Figure  3.11
). These evacuation orders show the ˚rst us e of the ‚evacuation grid™ that the Israeli 
military would later announce publicly on 1 December 2023.
46
 
On 13 October 2023, an evacuation order for northern Gaza was diss eminated via airdropped lea˘ets. 
The order instructed all people residing north of Wadi Gaza, approximately 1.1 million Palestinians, to 
evacuate their homes within 24 hours and move s outh of Wadi Gaza (s ee 
Figure   3.12
).
47
 
Two Facebook posts by an I sraeli milit ary spokesperson, on 13 an d 14 October, described Salah al-Din  
Road and al-Rashid Road as ‚safe routes™ to us e to evacuate s outh.
24
 We veri˚ed reports of civilians 
being attacked on Salah al-Din Road on 13 October as they attempted to go s outh [M3101312535] 
(s ee

).
48
 
On 21 October, a map released by the Israeli military announced that ‚anyone who is within 1000 metres  
of the s ecurit y fence is putting his life in danger.™ (s ee 
Figure  3.14
).  [M4102115028]

In October, the Isra eli military p ublished three di˜erent boundar ies for the area de˚ned as the 
‚humanitarian zon e™ in al-Mawas i (see 
Figure 3.15
).
25
  The boundary publish ed on 30 October was 
repeated multiple  times  and  the  map  is  accompanied  by  text  in  A rabic,  which  translates  to  ‚illustrative  
drawing™ or ‚explanatory diagram™ in English.
50
 
B y the end of November, the Israeli military had invaded large parts of the area north of Wadi Gaza and  
dem arcated a line, likely carved o ut by a military bulldozer, approxim ately 3km north of Wadi Gaza . This  
line appeared to s erve as the operational boundary dividing the ‚north™ from the ‚s outh™. Palestinians 
who ˘ed s outh were stopped from returning north through t wo checkpoints at the inters ection of this 
demarcated line and Salah al-Din Road and al-Rashid Road (s ee

52
 
A day later, on 2 December 2023, th e I sraeli milit ary issued th e ˚rst evacuation orders in the south 
for a large area east of Khan Younis, ordering c ivilians to move towards Rafah. The ‚evacuation grid™ 
was also use d in north G aza in two additional orders, in structing c ivilian s in Jabalia to evacuate to

The following day, on 3 December, the Israeli military ordered additional areas in Khan Yo unis to

Quantitative Findings
1.1
 
The territory including destination areas and the ‚humanitarian zone™ shrank over time:
(a)
 
On 13 O ctober 2023, this area included all of Gaza south of Wadi Gaza and covered 228 .2 
s q km (62. 5%) of the total territory of Gaza
(b)
 
On 7 January 2024, it included Rafah, Deir al-Balah, and the al-Mawasi ‚humanitarian zone™, 
covering 80.7 s q km (22.1%) of Gaza
(c)
 
On 6 May 2024, it shrank to include onl y the newl y estab li she d ‚expande d humanitarian zone™,  
covering 60.9 s q km (16.6%) of Gaza
(d )
 
On 16 August 2024, the ‚humanitarian zone™ contracted. The area covers 37.9 s q km (10.4%) 
of  Gaza
(e)
 
On 30 August 2024, three blocks have been reintegrated to the ‚expanded humanitarian 
zone™, exp anding its extent to covering 47.4 s q km (13%) of Gaza
(f)
 
The boundaries of the ‚humanitarian zone™ established from 18 October 2023 changed nine 
times by 30 August 2024.
1.2
 
Between 7 October 2023 and 31 August 2024, 84% of Gaza™s total area was subject to evacuation 
orders (see 
Figure 3.40
):
(a)
 
The 13 October evacuation order covered 37% of the total area of Gaza
(b)
 
After the grid-bas ed evacuation orders were introduced on 1 December, most areas in Gaza 
were ordered to evacuate at le ast on c e . Between 1 Dec ember 2023 an d 31 August 2024, 
72% of Gaza™s total area was subject to evacuation orders (s ee

(d )
 
A total of 66 evacuation orders were issued bet ween 7 October 2023 and 31 August 2024. 
Most orders refer to multiple blocks at a time.

Pat tern Fin dings
2.1
 
The Israeli military has continuously attacked all areas of Gaza such that no place may reasonably 
be considered safe.
63
 
We analys ed the location and timing of all incidents of Israeli attacks in our cartographic databas e in 
relation to the status of the areas they occurred in.
6 4
 
Our data show s that the Israeli military at tacked all area s in Gaza, including when they belonged to 
the following categories:
(a)
 
Destination areas Œ areas to which civilians were ordered to evacuate, including the 
‚humanitarian  zone™
(b)
 
‚Safe routes™ Œ routes designated by the Isra e li military for civilians to ‚safe ly™ evacuate through
(c)
 
Unde˚ned areas Œ are as which have neither be en de signated as evacuation are as nor 
destination  areas
(d )
 
Evacuation areas Œ areas from which civilians were ordered to evacuate 
65
 
The following map (s e e 
Figure   3.43
) demonstrates that attacks by the Israeli military camp aign have 
been pervasive regardless of the designation of an area as a site of shelter, evacuation, or unde˚ned.

Incidents of direct attacks on civilians
66
 
We have documented and archived instances where the Israeli military has directly targeted civilians, 
including two cas es in Gaza Cit y in November. In the ˚rst cas e, the Israeli s oldiers killed Atta Ibrahim 
al-Mu qayad, a deaf and m ute 73 year old Palestinian inside his home in Gaza City.
28
 In the seco nd 
cas e, the Israe li military shot and killed Hala Khreis, a Palestinian woman attempting to evacuate with 
her grandson, while holding a white ˘ag.
29
67
 
A nother cas e is an attack on civilians as they were following Israeli evacuation orders: on 2 9 January 
2024 in Gaza Cit y, a six-year- old Palestinian child, Hind Rajab, and six of her family members, as well 
as t wo Palestine Red Crescent Societ y (PRCS) paramedics, were attac ked and killed by the Israe li 
military while evacuating from an area subject to an evacuation order.
68
 
We investigated the killing of Hind Rajab, and from our sp atial and audio analysis concluded that the 
Israeli mili tar y direc tly s hot at the c ar Hind and her family we re in at close range, w he re they would 
have been able to identify civilians and children were pres ent and injured in the vehicle. Furthermore, 
we es tablished that the direc tio n fro m w hich the ambulance that tried to reach the m was shot at is 
consistent with the location of the Israeli military on that day.

Attacks on destination areas

Our res earch records 1,028 airstrikes in Gaza bet ween 7 and 28 October. Of thes e, 426 were in areas 
s outh of Wadi Gaza, even though the Israeli military had ordered the southward evacuation of all 
Gazans north of Wadi G aza (s ee 
Figure   3.45
).  
Figure   3.45
 demonstrates that the Israeli strikes were 
widespread and continuous north and s outh of Wadi Gaza, including after the 13 October evacuation 
order instructing civilians to move s outh of Wadi Gaza. This data demonstrates that the Israeli military 
targeted the area s outh of Wadi Gaza despite designating it as a destination area.

Our analys is sugge sts that th e size an d b o undarie s of th e ‚hum anitarian zone™ in al-Mawasi have varied substantia l ly. 
Th e b oun dary pub lish e d on 21 Octob er 2 023 marks th e b order of the zon e in th e context of an evac uation order instructin g

Appendix,,"for chronology of t he al-Mawasi ‚humanitarian zone™ boundary).

When the Israeli military announced the ‚exp ansion™ of the al-Mawasi ‚humanitarian zone™ (on 28 A pril 
in English and 6 May in A rabic), the newly published boundaries, while extending the ‚humanitarian 
zone™ northwards, als o excluded an area of approximately 5.87 s q km at the s outhern end of the zone, 
which had been part of the previo us boundary. T he 28 April announcement did not acknowledge 
or make any explicit reference to this exclusion, and our res earch has not identi˚ed any subs equent 
publication which acknowledged it. 
88
 
Civilians within the excluded zone, who did not realis e they were no longer within the ‚humanitarian 
zone™, stayed in place and were killed in subs equent Israeli airstrikes. 
194
Figure 3.59. 
Our anal ysis shows t hat t he 28 April announcement regarding t he expansion of t he al-Mawasi ‚humanitarian zone™ 
excluded 5.87 s q km from t he previously recognis ed area.
195
89
 
Rather than clearly marking the newly excluded zone, on 6 May the Israeli military releas ed maps that 
pres ented a suppos ed ‚previous™ boundary for the ‚humanitarian zone™ that excluded this same zone, 
sugge sting continuity between the se published zone s (see 
Figure  3.60
). H owever, we were unab le 
to  identify any  maps published prior  that  included b oundaries for  the ‚humanitarian  zone™  matching 
this  ‚previous™  boundary.
 
 
Figure 3.60. 
In blue : mult iple boundaries p ublished for t he al-Mawasi ‚humanitarian zone™. In dark or ange : a boundary of what 
t he Isr aeli military referred to as t he ‚previous™ boundary of al-Mawasi before it was ‚expanded™. This boundary does not match 
any of the boundaries published before.
196

A 6 May post on Facebook from the account of an Israe li military spokesperson desc ribes an expansion 
of the al-Mawasi ‚humanitarian zone™ as follows: ‚the safe zone was expanded from Deir al-Balah in 
the north, to blocks 2360, 2371, 2373 in the s outh.™ That text description was illustrated by a drawing 
in which the ‚humanitarian zone™ appeared to include p arts of thos e three blocks, but not all of them.
37
9 1
 
Adding to the confusion, the newly de˚ned boundary, as repres ented in a video attached to an X post 
from the same spokespers on on the same day, appears to exclude those three blocks. This created 
a disp arit y bet ween the information communicated by the spokespers on™s words and the ass ociated 
drawing and video. 
92
 
That video al so sh ows th e boun daries of th e zone expan ding in a way that makes th e actual extent 
of the zone harder to interpret, suggesting that additional areas of s outhern Gaza are included in the 
‚humanitarian  zone™.  
93
 
Additionally, the ‚numbered blocks™ on which the Israeli evacuation grid is based are not widely 
understood on the ground. For many among Gaza™s civilian population, there is no easy way to ˚gure 
out what ‚block™ they are in.
94
 
Our anal ysi s of satellite image s indicates an incre ased density of tent s in the excluded are a after the new  
boundary was announced, apparently con˚rming that displaced civilians did not understand this area 
to be outside the ‚humanitarian zone™ which they had previously been directed into (s ee 
Figure   3.61
).

Issuing unclear and inconsistent evacuation orders
97
 
Our analysis reveals numerous inconsistencies by the Israe li military in labelling, marking, and naming 
evacuation  areas:
(a)
 
In the neighbourhood-bas ed map announced on 2 December 2023, our analysis identi˚ed 
at le ast three errors in the alignment between the names and location s of neighbourhoods 
on the provided map. Consequently, residents in these neighbourhoods faced signi˚ cant 
uncertainty as to when their neighbourhood was mentioned, as it was unclear whether civilians  
residing there should evacuate, or if the map incorrectly referred to a di˜erent location of the 
same name.
40
(b)
 
In at leas t seve ntee n ins tances of evacuatio n o rd er s, the s ha d ed areas on the map pos ted 
by th e I sraeli milit ary onlin e, in dicatin g th e blocks instructed to evacuate, did n ot align with 
the block numbers listed in the order (s ee A ppendix for non- grid-bas ed evacuation orders).
(c)
 
In nin e di˜erent I sraeli milit ary evac uation orders, the shaded areas de signatin g are as subject  
to evacuation orders did not correspond with the blocks in the evacuation grid. Instead, the 
borders of those areas crossed over the borders of the blocks , resulting in some blocks being 
partially included and partially excluded. T his has produced further uncertainty among civilians  
in those areas abou t whethe r they are being instru c ted to evacuate. One pe r so n res po nded to  
a similar map published by the Israeli military on Facebook on 2 December 2023 in a comment  
asking for clari˚cation regarding the areas designated for evacuation: ‚Is Block 53 in Ma™an 
instructe d to evacuate? Please respond.™ No response to their question was ever posted.
(d )
 
In s ome evacuation orders, named locations on the map have been mislabeled. For example, 
in one order on 2 December 2023, residents were instructed to go to Daraj and Tu˜ah Œ both 
areas that are located within the areas highlighted for evacuation, while the bottom arrow in 
the map points to Shuja™iyya, which is not labelled.
41
(e)
 
Evacuation orders referring to the same area may come from multiple s ources and images, 
along with inconsistencies and contradictions . For example, in the announcement published on  
Facebook on 2 December 2023 ordering area s in K han Younis to evacuate, three overlapping 
but signi˚cantl y di˜erent re gion s are highlighte d in separate images and publi shed side 
by  side.

Instructing civilians to evacuate to areas that were attacked soon after
98
 
Evacuation orders have als o directed civilian s towards districts which were subjected to airstrikes or 
military activit y shortly afterwards (s ee
 Figure  
 
3.46
).  
99
 
On 7 July 2024, multiple blocks in Gaza Cit y were ordered to evacuate west (s ee 
Figure   3.63
 [Map ID: 
M4070740993]). Less than 24 hours later, families were reportedly besieged by the Israeli military 
in the same area they were told to evacuate to.

the Israeli military invade d the same area that it had instructed civilians to evacuate to the day b efore

orders. Th e evacuation order (for blocks 107, 112, 110, 109, 111, an d 108) came on e day after 
the ground invasion, on 23 January.

Alre ad y in the ˚rst phase of the evac uation orders, outlined ab ove , Pale stinian re sident s in the nor thern  
areas of Gaza were instructed to go to the areas south of Wadi Gaza, including the refugee camps 
in the middle of G aza (Wusta) and Khan Youni s. Tho se same areas later re ceive d evacuation orders 
from the Israeli military.
105
 
During the se cond phas e of the evacuation orders, on 8 De cemb er 2023, residents of Jabalia, Shujaiyeh,  
Zaytoun, and the Old Cit y of Gaza were instructed to evacuate towards the s outhwestern p art of Gaza

Displacing civilians to destination areas that were previously targeted and destroyed
1 15
 
Ci vilians have been repeatedly displaced to areas with insu˜icient es sential services as a result of 
previous airstrikes or military activit y. On 6 May, Palestinians were ordered to move to the al-Mawasi 
‚humanitarian zone™ after many of its buildings had already been destroyed or damaged. UNOSAT 
data, veri˚ed by our own analysis, suggests that the total number of buildings completely destroyed 
in al-Mawasi was 6 ,250, with 2,940 being s everely damaged, a further 8,526 moderatel y damaged, 
and over 4,000 identi˚ed as possibly damaged. 
1 16
 
Eac h of the six hospitals located within the ‚exp anded humanitarian zone™ have been forced out of 
service at di˜erent times since 7 Octob er 2023; four out of six were out of servic e at the beginning 
of May. 
1 17
 
According to data from Gaza™s C oastal Municip alit y Water Utilit y (CMWU) datas et and veri˚ed by our 
analysis, by the end of May 2024, 61% of all water infrastructure located within the ‚humanitarian zone™ 
was damaged or de stroyed (67% of it s water wells, 56% of it s water tanks, 36% of it s de salination plant s).
1 18
 
The 6 May boundary of the ‚humanitarian zone™ included 19 s q km of agricultural land. By the end of 
June, 11 s q km or 56% of this agricultural land was destroyed. Furthermore, 48% of the greenhous es 
within this ‚humanitarian zone™ were either damaged or destroyed by the end of June, leaving the area 
lacking basic  amenities. 
1 19
 
Infra struc ture such a s the 765.67 km road networ k in the ‚humanitarian zone™ has also sustained signi˚ c ant  
damage, with 86.7 km destroye d, 35.75 km s everely damaged, and 233.36 km moderately damaged.

civilians evacuating from the north following the 13 October 2023 evacuation order required them to

data-gathering and surveillance through facial recognition software is in use at these and other

The Israeli military used ‚protective measures™ to displace Palestinians
1 24
 
As noted in Chapter 2:"
Spatial Control,,", the military constructed a set of spatial e lem ents, including 
barriers, routes, checkpoints, and bu˜er zones across Gaza. The Netzarim corridor was established 
between north and s outh Gaza following the p ath of the 13 O ctober evacuation order. The corridor 
c reated  a large and impenetrable  barrier between the  evacuation area in the north and the  destin ation  
are as in th e south. Where the two main nor thŒsouth roads meet the corridor, th e Israeli military plac ed  
t wo large one-way checkpoints, allowing civilians to leave the south and barring their reentry north. 
The construction of the corridor thus relates to the issuing of evacuation orders to the evacuation 
areas.  The  in˘iction  of  large-scale  destruction  in  the  evacuation areas,  and  the  construction  of  well-
built physical barriers bet ween the evacuation areas and the destination areas suggests to us that"

which has good agricultural s oil, to coastal sand dunes in the west (s ee Chapter 4: Destruction of

The al-Mawasi area was als o devoid of su˜icient infrastructure for medical care and food. It thereafter 
became  the  largest  concentration  of  displaced  pers ons.

By 2 9 May, the Israeli ground invasion had fully s eized control of the Philadelphi corridor. On 6 May, 
Israel took control of the Rafah crossing, a critical entry point for humanitarian aid, and forced most 
of Gaza™s remaining functional hospitals in the Rafah area out of s ervice (s ee Chapter 5: Destruction 
of  Medical  Infrastructure).
135
 
The al-M awasi area was alre ady struggling to accommodate an in˘ux of displaced people due to 
its limited shelter capa city even before the invasion of Rafah. It o˜ered limited a ccess to essential 
resources such as food, clean water, sanit ation, an d h ealthcare (see Chapter 5 : Destr uction of 
Medical  Infrastructure).
136
 
The Israeli military funnelled civilians from the north of Gaza, as well as from the eastern part of the 
s outh into the al-Mawasi area through successive evacuation orders.
137
 
Following the invasion of Rafah, and the earlier withdrawal of the Isra eli military from Khan Younis, 
many Palestinians decided to return to eastern p arts of Khan Younis.
138
 
However, the Israeli military launche d a se cond invasion of that area, and our data shows that Palestinian  
civilians were forced to evacuate west wards into the ‚exp anded humanitarian zone™. Videos posted on 
s ocial networks showed many Palestinians displaced from Khan Younis for a s econd time sleeping in 
the open, as al-Mawasi was unable to accommodate another wave of new evacuees.

4.  Destruction  of  Agriculture  a nd  Water  Reso urces
1
 
This ch apter  examines the  Israe li military™s  destruction  of  farmlands, greenhous es  and  agricultural 
infrastructure, including water infrastructure, across Gaza since October 2023.
240
A˜
GLOSSARY
2
 
Flora
:  plant  life.
3
 
Farm
: a plot or area of land devoted to agricultural cultivation or livestock. In Gaza, farms are also 
commonly places of residence for agricultural workers.
4
 
Greenhou se
: a roofed building or structure made of metal sheets and covered by glass, cloth, or 
oth er transparent material s used by agricultural workers for intensive c ultivation of plants. In Gaza, 
greenhous es often grow crops vertically, increasing yield of crops per s quare metre.
5
 
Agricultural infrastructure
: farms, orchards , greenhouses, and their corresp onding water facilities, 
including water tanks and wells. 
Water wells usually consist of an underground borehole and electric 
pump, together with a small control room above ground.
6
 
Earth b erm
: a shaped mound of earth piled above the surrounding ground leve l, developed as p art of 
milit ary earthworks. Commonly used as a protective screen against gun˚re or hand-laun ch ed mis siles.  
7
 
Urban  water  inf rastr ucture
: pipeline s, groundwater wells, re servoirs, de salination plants, seawater 
treatment  facilities  in  urban  areas.  
8
 
Raid rou te
: ‚raid routes™ are used by the Israeli military to conduct raids from inside Israel deep into 
Gaza. C ommonly, thes e routes are linked directly to roads and military bas es in Israel. 
9
 
C orridors
: t
wo major ‚corridors™ have been constructed by the Israeli military in Gaza since October 
2023. The corridors consist of wide strips of expos ed land either side of a through road, dotted with 
buildings and other military infrastructure. T he two major corridors operate as dividing lines and 
checkpoints, as well as facilitating the movement of military equipment and s oldiers. 
10
 
Perimeter
: the eastern and northern boundaries of G aza, which are forti˚ed by the Israeli military 
and restrict access in and out of the territory. This study employs the terms ‚perimeter ™, ‚fence™, and 
‚frontier ™  interchangeably  to  describe  this  area.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
1˜
Quantitative ˚n dings
1.1
 
Between 7 October 2023 and 30 June 2024:
(a)
 
A pproximately 83% of all plant life in Gaza was destroyed.
(b)
 
Ap proximately 70% of Gaz a™s agricul tural land, 10 4 sq km (ou t of 150 sq km) of ˚elds and 
orchards, were destroyed.
(c)
 
More than 3,700 greenhous e structures in Gaza, 45% of its total, were destroyed.
(d )
 
More than 47% of gro undwater wells and 65% of water tanks were destroyed or damaged. 
The status of 2 9% of the wells is unknown. 
(e)
 
None of the wastewater treatment facilities in Gaza have remained intact or functional. 
2˜
Pat tern ˚n dings
2.1
 
The Israeli military repeatedly destroyed agriculture and water resources across Gaza.
(a)
 
Mo nth-by-mo nth analysis in this pe riod shows a c o r relation between the des truc tio n of 
agricultural  lands  and  infrastructure,  and  the  Israeli  military™s  ground position.
(b)
 
The  destruction  of  agricultural  lands  and infrastructure was  cumulative and  repeated.
(c)
 
Agriculture and water res ources were destroyed using military equipment and weapons.
2.2
 
The Israeli military™s conduct has likely caused contamination in Gaza™s land and water resources.
242
C˜
BACKGROUND
1 1
 
Prior to October 2023, Gaza contained over 150 sq km of agric ultural land, accounting for about 
41% of its total area. Thes e agricultural ˚elds and orchards, together with over 8,00 0 greenhous e 
str uctures identi ˚ed thro ugh o ur analysis, served as a local source of food security an d in come for 
besieged Palestinians. 
1 2
 
A reas of Gaza were known to produce a particular agricultural product. In the north, B eit Lahiya was 
known for its strawberries, mainly for exp ort, while the bulk of Gaza™s citrus wa s pro duced in Beit 
Hanoun, including oranges and grapefruits.  
13
 
Known locally as the ‚food basket™ of Gaza, agricultural lands and infrastructure along the eastern 
perimeter, on fertile loess s oil, were a cornerstone of local food s ecurit y.
14
 
The perimeter around Gaza constitutes a s ophisticated system of fences, forts and surveillance 
technologies. Since 2005, when Israel evacuated its settlem ents and bases from Gaza, the Israeli 
mili tar y has bar red Gaz a resid e nts from ap p roaching the p erimete r fe nce. The mili tar y created a 300m  
‚bu˜er zone™ on formerly cultivated farmland, enforced by live ˚re.
1
 Across subs equent Israeli military 
incursions, the bu˜er zone has been progressively transformed into a ‚no -go area™, extending across 
urban  areas  and  farmland.
15
 
When Palestinian farmers try to plant into the bu˜er zone, the Israeli military destroys their crops 
using bulldozers an d, s ince 2014, th e unann ounced aerial sprayin g of herbicides. Th e sprayin g has 
destroye d  large  areas  of arable  land  in  Gaza.
2
16
 
In addition to the bu˜er zone, restrictions on farmers clos e to Gaza™s eastern perimeter barred them 
from cultivating crops of over 1m in height, to facilitate optimal s ecurit y visibilit y for the Israeli military.
3
 
This re striction compelled agricultural workers to transition f rom fruit tree s to lower-growing crop s with  
higher s eas onal turnaround. C ons equently, the main agricultural products cultivated at the perimeter 
prior to Oc tober 2023 included zuc chini, eggplants, basil, cucumbe rs, tomatoes, onions, potatoes, 
herbs and dates. Further back from the fence, olive tree orchards were planted where possible.

According to a repor t by Oxfam in April 2024 , ‚people in nor thern Gaza have been forc ed to survi ve on an  
average of 245 calories a day Œ less than a can of fava beans Œ since January, a s Israeli forces continue 
their military onslaught™.
4
 This is far below the minimum daily caloric threshold the Israeli government 
has us ed for almost t wo de cades in its calculations of what is needed to prevent malnutrition in the 
population of Gaza. In its 20 07 report ‚Food C onsumption in the Gaza Strip Œ Red Lines™, made public 
by the Israeli rights group GIS HA in 2012,
5
 the Israeli government determined, considering factors like 
age and gender, that an average of 2,279 calories per pers on per day was required for survival (245 
calories per day is 11% of that recommended requirement). 
18
 
Our analysi s builds on our previous res earch with local farmers™ ass ociations and agricultural workers

SCOPE
19
 
We conducte d an analysi s of open- sourc e vide o s, remote- sensing satellite image s, witne ss te stimony  
and United Nations data to examine the levels of destruction of agricultural farmland and infra structure  
throughout Gaza from 7 October 2023 to 30 June 2024.
20
 
Through this, we identi˚ed six areas of study:
(a)
 
Destruction of the ˘ora of Gaza. 
(b)
 
Total area of ˚elds and orchards that have been destroyed. 
(c)
 
The number and proportion of greenhous es destroyed.
(d )
 
The number and proportion of urban water s ources destroyed.
(e)
 
Pattern s  in  the  destruction  of  agriculture.
(f)
 
Implications  of  the  correlation  bet ween  agricultural  destruction  and  the ground  invasion.
21
 
Our analysis relies on the coverage and res olution of available satellite imagery. For example, heavy 
cloud coverage in satellite images during the months of October 2023 and February 2024 reduced 
our ability to con duct a Normalised Di˜eren ce Veget ation In dex (NDVI) analysis (see M ethodology) 
for thes e months. 
245
E˜
MATERIALS USED IN ANALYSIS
22
 
Our study relied on the following sources:
23
 
C opernicus™ A rchive of Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites
: this provides 10 m to 60 m res olution 
multispectral data across 13 bands, covering the visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared p arts 
of the spectrum. These satellites o˜er system atic global coverage of land surfaces between 56° S and 
84° N, as we ll as coastal waters and the entire Mediterranean Sea, with revisit times of approximately 
˚ve days due to the combined operation of both Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B. 
24
 
Planet Lab™s archive of PlanetScope satellites
: images at 3.7m res olution in four multispectral bands: 
RGB and near-infrared. 
25
 
Plan et Lab™s archive of S kysat satellites
: app roximately 450 images at 50 cm reso lution, in ˚ve 
multispe ctral  bands:  RGB  and  near-infrared.  
26
 
Land cla ssi˚cation develop ed by Remote S ensing and Land Science Lab (SensLand Lab)
: this 
classi˚cation visualis es land us e in Gaza in 2023 up until 6 October 2023, at a sp atial res olution of 10 
m, using all available imagery from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. It includes ten land cover/use classes, 
ranging fro m high-d e nsi ty d evel o ped area to wo ody/natural vegetatio n.

METHODOLOGY
32
 
Satellite ‚re mote sens ing™ d ata
 of vegetatio n allow s us to stu dy and pl ot chang es in si te c ondi tio ns 
and  botanical  transformation  over  time  and monitor  multi-year  changes  in  vegetation  p atterns.   
33
 
‚Mosaic™
 refers to a process of blending multiple S entinel-2 im ages over a de˚ned time period, 
computing the median pixel value for each location, and clipping the ˚nal image to the desired region. 
This produces a composite image that is robust, less a˜ected by temporary changes or clouds, and 
covers the entire area of interest. For each mosaic, we us ed all available cloud-free Sentinel-2 satellite 
data in each month.

The NDVI
 is a common and widely us ed remote s ensing index. It is calculated as the ratio bet ween 
Top of Atmosphere (TOA) re˘ectance of a red band (
ÿ
 red) around 0.66 micrometres (m) and a near-
inf rared (NIR) band (
ÿ
 nir) around 0.86 m. Th e NDVI of a densely vegetated are a will ten d towards 
positive values, whereas water and built-up areas will be repres ented by near zero or negative values. 
Formally, NDVI is given by B raun and Herold (2004) as:
35
 
NDVI = (
ÿ
 n ir  
ÿ
 red) / (
ÿ
 n ir+  
ÿ
 red)
36
 
H e althy veget ation typically has NDVI values between 0.2 and 0.8, usin g 0 as th e minimum will 
emphasis e thes e vegetated areas with more colour di˜erentiation, while non-vegetated areas will be 
less detailed. 
37
 
Cartographic  R e gression
 in this chapter involves comp aring NDVI analysis or satellite imagery from 
the sam e area to tra ck changes in the territory and determine how the land scape of Gaza before 7 
October 2023 corresponds to the pres ent day. It allows us to map what has been destroyed at regular 
intervals and to deduce the p atterns of destruction over a long period of time.

TIMELINE
1˜
7ˆ27 October 2023: aerial bombardment 
38
 
Starting o n 7 Oc tobe r 2023 , Is rael began o ne of the larg es t bombing c ampaigns in mili tar y his tor y. 
Most airstrikes during this period were directed towards Gaza™s built-up urban areas in the north. Our 
analysis suggests that while agricultural facilities were not a main target, clusters of greenhous es in 
the a gr icultural areas of the eastern per im eter were hit. On 13 O ctober, the Isra eli military gave an 
evacuation order to Palestinians in northern Gaza.

The Israeli military™s ground invasion ˚rst surrounded Gaza Cit y and the camps around it. One of the 
directions of inva sion wa s along the northern p erimeter in the largely agricultural areas of Beit Hanoun 
and Beit Lahiya. Thi s line of invasion progressed s outhwards along the coastal al-Rashid Road. The 
other direction wa s an ea stŒwest wedge south of Gaza City, from the ea stern p erimeter of Gaza. It 
moved along Wadi Gaza in an area now referred to as the ‚Netzarim corridor ™. These areas surrounding  
Gaza Cit y are the main agricultural areas in northern Gaza. As s oon as the ground invasion b egan, we 
n oticed large-scale destr uction of th ese areas. Th e marks of agricultural destr uction correspon d to 
the areas under ground invasion. Smaller p atches of agricultural destruction als o became noticeable 
in and around Rafah, very likely the result of airstrikes. 
40
 
In November 2023, 28.8 sq km of agricultural lan d was subject to groun d invasion, more than 7 sq 
km of which wa s destroyed during that p erio d. T his means that nearly 25% of the total agricultural 
area under invasion was destroye d. By comp aris on: during Russia™s invasion of Ukraine, throughout 
2023, only 7. 5% of the total croplands were damaged in that year.
8
 This scale of destruction suggests 
it was not an in cidental impact of the progress of military operations and vehicles but part of an 
intended outcome.

Our analysis shows further agricultural destruction around the ˚elds along Gaza™s eastern perimeter 
during this period, in East Jabalia, bet ween Deir al-Balah and Wadi Gaza, and in the villages east of 
Khan Younis. While thes e areas were subject to ground invasion, destruction of agriculture took place 
outside of the p ath of military movement.

FebruaryŒMarch 2024: invasion in the south deepens
43
 
We obs erved the destruction of large swathes of agricultural land: along the s outheastern perimeter, 
between Khan Younis and Rafah, along the northern p erimeter, and south of Gaza City. The lat ter 
facilitated the construction of the Net zarim corridor, which stretched from the eastern perimeter to 
the s ea, surrounded by a wide bu˜er zone in which every building or agricultural facilit y on both sides 
of the road was destroyed.
 
44
 
The end of winter in March 2024 marked a new per iod of military operations in southern Gaza, 
speci˚cally in Khan Younis. Much of the agricultural loss in March corresponded to the areas under 
ground invasion, though large areas of agricultural land near Rafah, which at that time were not subject  
to ground invasion, were subject to crop loss becaus e farmers had been forced to abandon their land. 
6˜
5 April 2024: par tial with drawal from south Gaza
45
 
In April, large swathes of agricultural land within a 1 km o˜set of the eastern perimeter of Gaza, between  
Deir al-Balah and north Gaza, were destroyed. This area corresponds with the area that is maintained 
by the Israeli military as an ‚exp anded™ bu˜er zone
.

  A thick bu˜er zone was als o visible in the wider 
areas on both sides of the road along the Netzarim corridor.

QUANTITATIVE FINDINGS 
7. 1
 
Destruction of Flora 
47
 
We use d remote sensing to measure the vegetation loss in Gaza since 7 October 2023, using NDVI. 
The ‚vegetation index™ is an indicator of the health and robustness of plant life in a region over time, 
measured by analysing satellite imagery. We analys ed data for the month of June over a period of four 
years to maintain similar environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and rainfall).
48
 
This process suggests that 83% of plant life registered in earlier years ha s been destroyed. For example,  
in Khan Yo unis, approxim ately 50 sq km o ut of 59 sq km of area with healthy plant life in the region 
has been lost. In Rafah, 21 s q km has been lost out of a total of 24 s q km.
4 9
 
The destruction of ˘ora will imp act on Gaza™s terrestrial biodiversit y and food systems. As such, it will 
undermine ecosystem health and resilience.

We us ed land classi˚cation analysis developed by SensLand Lab to distinguish agricultural land from 
the native ˘ora of Gaza prior to October 2023. Before 7 October 2023, agriculture was respons ible 
for 41% of Gaza™s total area.

shows that in this time, 104 s q km out of 150 s q km of the 
agricultural lan d in Gaza, nearly 70% of its tot al, had been lost . Our analysis sh ows that th e los s is 
due to destruction by Israeli military activity and crop loss resulting from land being abandoned by 
displaced farmers. 
258

Destruction of greenhouses
52
 
Greenhouse s are a vital par t of Gaza™s domestic food inf rastructure. Working f rom satellite imagery 
from June 2023, we mapped every visible greenhouse structure throughout Gaza. We mapped a total 
of 8,339 structures. Some were in northern Gaza, but most were s outh of Wadi Gaza in Deir al-Balah, 
Khan Younis, and Rafah. In our classi˚cation, the architectural signatures of a greenhous e include:

Our analys is suggests that between October 2023 and June 2024, more than 2,000 greenhouses 
were damaged (light purple) and 1,750 were destroyed (purple) (

of the greenh o uses were dam aged or destroyed by th e I sraeli military and approxim ately only half 
remain  in tact  (grey).

Destruction of water sources
56
 
Pipelines , desalinations plants , groundwater reservoirs , and reservoirs are key sources of domestic 
water  within  Gaza.
11
5 7
 
Pipelines:  
58
 
A bout 12% of G aza™s total available water prior to 9 October 2023 was provided by Mekorot, Israel™s 
national water company. Al M ontar, B ani Suhaila, and B ani S aeed pipelin es, which supply water to 
Gaza Cit y, Khan Younis, and Deir al-Balah, were reportedly cut o˜ on 9 October 2023. The latter t wo 
were reactivated on 31 October 2023, but interruptions followed.
12
 From 9 October 2023 to 26 May 
2024, water supply averaged 12,168m
3 
/day Œ less than a quarter (22%) of their cap acit y.
59
 
Desalination  plants  and wastewater  treatment  f ac ilities:
60
 
Together, desalination plants and wastewater tre atment fac ilities provide d 6 % of the 
total water availab le  
to  the  population  of  Gaza.
13
 Gaza™s C oastal Municip alit y Water Utilit y recorded 2 9 desalination plants 
and eight wastewater treatment facilities before October 2023.
61
 
We anal ysed the ex tent of the damage b rought to tho se plant s betwe en 7 October 2023 and the end of  
June 2024. By the end of this period, no wastewater treatment facilities in Gaza remained operational. 
Eight desalination plants were either damaged or destroyed. The status of 16 
facilities 
could not be 
con˚rmed with satellite imagery.
62
 
Reportedly, since October 2023, NGOs have waited months to receive ‚pre- clearance™ to enter Gaza 
with  replacement  p arts  for  damaged  water  treatment  infrastructure.

Water wells and reser voirs:
6 4
 
Groundwater acco unted for 81% of the total water available to the population in Gaza before 7 October 
2023. It is acc e ssed through wells and re servoirs.
 
15
 The database of Gaza™s Coastal Municipality Water  
Utilit y (CMWU) lists 369 groundwater wells and 52 tanks and res ervoirs.
65
 
Water wells are usually compos ed of an underground borehole, an electric pump, and a small control 
room above ground. This infrastructure has been s everel y damaged, a˜ecting vital water res ources, 
and remains inadequate due to fuel shortages. The status of the groundwater wells is best examined 
by engineers and technicians on the ground. If ground access is not possible, analysis of the status 
of the wells will remain inconclusive. The databas e of the CMWU shows that since 7 October 2023, 
more than 47% of urban water wells are either destroyed or damaged. The status of 29% of the wells 
is unknown due to the di˜iculty of accessing them. We used this data set to analyse the extent of 
the damage.
66
 
While wells are challenging to detect via satellite imagery, we ass ess e d the status of water tanks 
through v isual ev ide nce using high-reso lution Planet Sat images. Their dis tinc t s truc ture is more easily 
visible from satellite images, and the CMWU datas et includes their coordinates, aiding identi˚cation. 
Many of the damaged tanks lack s olar p anels or show clear damage, indicating that thes e key pieces 
of infrastructure are no longer operational. Our analysis shows that over 6 5% of the water tanks and 
res ervoirs have been either destroyed or damaged.
67
 
The levels of devastation brought by this destruction varies across di˜erent p arts of Gaza, with s evere 
health imp acts on all s ectors of the Palestinian population in Gaza. For example, over 60 % of the wells 
in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah are either destroyed or damaged. The scale of destruction is similar 
in north Gaza, at 55%.

November 2023 characteris es the early stage of the full-scale military invasion of Gaza by the Israeli 
military. The marks of agricultural destruction along the p erimeter c orresp ond to the area s under 
ground invasion. Smaller p atches of change in the health of plant life in Rafah may indicate the imp act 
of aerial bombardments. 
75
 
Th e areas overt aken by the I sraeli groun d invasion in November 2023 in cluded 29 sq km of agricultural  
land. Our analysis shows that from thes e over 7 s q km have been destroyed. This amounts to nearly 
25% of the total agricultural area subject to ground invasion. 
76
 
Our analys is shows that 161 greenho uses were fully destroyed during November. O ver 340 greenho uses  
were within the area under the control of the Israeli military; 54% of these were fully destroyed. O verall,  
15% of Gaza™s greenhous es were a˜ected by the end of November.

92
 
Much of the agricultural loss in this month corresponds to the areas under ground invasion. A reas of 
agricultural land near Rafah that were not subject to ground invasion at the time neverthe less su˜ered 
from crop loss, as local farmers were displaced.
93
 
The areas over taken by the Israeli ground invasion in March 2024 include d ab out 80.4 sq km of 
agricultural land. Of this, 44 s q km was destroyed. This amounts to 54.4%, more than half of the total 
agricultural  area  under invasion.
94
 
Our analysis shows that 122 greenhous e structures were fully destroyed during March, most of which 
were situate d in north G aza along the perimeter and in Khan Youni s. Overall, 33% of G aza™s gre enhous es

Agriculture was one of the most productive sectors in Gaza prior to October 2023.
16
 The loss of 
agricul tural farmlands, their infras truc ture and sur rounding areas, translates into the e ntire l oss of 
livelihoods for Palestinian farmers Œ rendering them unable to support thems elves and their families. 
1 10
 
Agricultural destruction increases dependen cy on foreign aid and on the steady import of goods Œ both  
of which have been s everely restricted since October 2023. The reduction of local food production 
cap acit y combined with the restriction of imports into Gaza has resulted in a widely reported ongoing 
famine and cas es of malnutrition.

Bulldozers and routes: an orchard in east Jabalia 
1 14
 
Until October 2023, the A bu Su˜iyeh family cultivated one of the last olive, pomegranate, and citrus 
orchards near the eastern perimeter of Gaza, in east Jabalia.
1 15
 
A bout 500 m from the Israeli-impos ed bu˜er zone, agricultural land cultivated by farmers in this area 
was often threatened with bulldozing by the Israeli military, which declared that any vegetation higher 
than 1m in the vicinit y of their military no - go area was a s ecurit y threat and must be ˘attened.

Satellite images from the months that followed the ground invasion reveal the means and the scale of 
the Israeli military™s repeated destruction of the farm in east Jabalia (

Figure  4.44
, 
Figure

).
(a)
 
The surfac e area di splays cle ar signs of ploughing by D9 bulldozers to such an ex tent that 
the farm™s shape and boundaries are no longer discernible. Orchards are uprooted.
(b)
 
Infrastructure  necessary  for  cultivation,  such  as  the  water  tank,  are  destroyed.
(c)
 
High earth berms are piled on th e site of th e farm for the forti˚cation of I sraeli milit ary 
infrastructure, such as raid routes frequented by the military and encampments (s ee Chapter 
2:  Sp atial  control,  Figure  2.34  and  Figure 2.49).
(d )
 
A wide margin of clearing is developed around the raid route. 
1 19
 
Thes e interventions by the Israeli military prevent the A bu Su˜iyeh family from returning to their land. 
1 20
 
The m ovem ent of vehic l es over a gr icultural soil is harmful to a gr iculture in the long run for several reasons:
(a)
 
The intentional turning of the soil in the expanded Israeli-imposed bu ˜er zone leads to the 
destruction of irrigation sy stems and canals. T he topography of the surface is transformed 
by the piling of agricultural s oil into tall earth berms.
(b)
 
In area s where the earth is subjected to the move me nt of heav y mili tary ve hicles, soil bec omes  
compressed and its abilit y to absorb water and nutrients is limite d. Furthermore, fuel and 
machine oil leaks out of military vehicles, contaminating the s oil.
1 21
 
Statement provided to Foren sic A rchitecture by a f armer f rom the A bu Su˝iyeh f amil y:
 ‚I™m  telling  
you, there is no land at all now. The area is now back to pre-2000 state ... I mean, it is now the same 
as it was before: des ert. It™s again a des ert. There is no single tree there. No traces of prior life. If I was 
to go there, I wouldn™t be able to recognis e it. I mean, I cannot tell where the demarcations of my land

Airstrikes and bulldozers: greenhouses in Beit Hanoun

We documented the destruction of greenhous es in the historically agricultural area of B eit Hanoun in 
northeastern Gaza in t wo stages: 
(a)
 
Image from 30 October 2023 sh ows signatures of damaged due to aerial bombardment . 
We identi˚e d over a hundre d craters, with diameters of up to 1 m. Several buildings in the 
neighbourhood have als o been subjected to bombardment.
(b)
 
Image from 48 hours later, 1 November 2023, shows the transformation of the site into a 
military encampment area. The greenhous e structures are dismantled, the earth is ploughed 
by bulldozers, earth berms are s et up.
(c)
 
The earth berms are maintained on site after the military moves to the area. This allows the 
military to access this encampment site for future us e.
1 23

In a statement provide d to Forensic Archite cture, Mohammad al -Bakri, chairman of the Union of 
Agricultural Workers Committees in Gaza
, said the pat tern of widespread Israeli at tacks on greenhouses  
is part of the mili tar y™s p lan to dis p lace Pal es tinian resid e nts and re nd e r the land inac cessible. ‚The 
occup ation has destroyed our people, the stones, and the trees in the Gaza Strip. It has destroyed the 
land in order to displace the local Palestinian people, the people of this land, out of it™, al-Bakri said.
1 26
 
In a testimony shared with Forensic Architecture by Al Mez an, T., a farmer from Khan Younis (Abasan  
al-K abira) states
:
19
 ‚I am 84 years old, and I have been working in agriculture since 1980. I am married 
and support my family, my children and their children. I have 20 dunums of land in the cit y of A basan 
al-K abira, east of Khan Younis, on the lands of Wadi Saber. I grow vegetables, olives and s ome trees 
on my land, which is my main profession through which I support my family. However, with the start 
of the aggression, I was unable to cultivate my crops becaus e we were displaced from one place to 
another. I began to be displaced after the Israeli occup ation entered Khan Younis. [....] One year ago, 
before the pres ent aggression, we were harvesting olive trees, but even then, we could not complete 
the harvest becaus e of the occup ation and our inabilit y to reach our lands due to its proximit y to the 
[eastern] ﬁborderﬂ area [with Israel]. Now we cannot reach our lands despite our return to [the area] 
becaus e it has been subjected to shelling and targeting, alongside its neighbouring lands. Our land 
was subjected to direct strikes and random shelling, which destroyed all the vegetables and olive 
trees that were planted, as well as the destruction of the water lines leading to it and the destruction 
of the infrastructure. Agriculture is my prim ary profession, and we n ow depend directly on aid and 
assistance. I have not been able to harvest any crops since the aggression and the occup ation™s entry 
into Khan Younis. We are now unable to provide for ours elves due to the high cost of living, our need 
for medical treatment, for me and my wife, and our need for healthy food due to our old age.™
1 27
 
In a testimony share d with Forensic Archite cture by Al Mezan, A. , a far mer from Rafah states:
20
 
‚My agricultural lands, which are 9 dunams in addition to 5 greenhous es, is located in the [Mawarij] 
area of Rafah, an area currently controlled by the Israeli military. At the beginning of the war and until 
February [2024], I could onl y reach my land with great di˜iculty and fear, but we managed to plant 
cu cumber s, eggp lants and pe ppe rs o n it , and I u sed to take care of irr igating the cro ps daily and 
providing agricultural supplies, as their prices rose greatly, pesticides and seeds. Even obtaining water  
was expen sive becaus e we needed dies el to operate the water motor at times. The land and its crops 
were our only s ource of livelihood. But with the continuously intensi˚ed situation, it became di˜icult 
to reach our crops, and with the invasion of the cit y of Rafah in May 2024, reaching our lands became 
impossible. The latest we know about our land from s ome published photos is the destruction of 34 
s olar p anels, the complete destruction of 5 greenhous es, and the bulldozing of most of the crops. My 
loss es can be estimated at around t went y thousand dollars, in addition to the damage to the s oil that 
may spoil the crops from the e˜ects of explosive materials, and the e˜ect of the soil being pulveris ed 
by  the  occup ation™s  machinery.™

Pumping se awater into tunnels embedded in Gaza™s sand y and porous soil may re sult in saltwater 
seeping into underground water sources, mak ing underground wells unusable. Contaminating the 
aquifers with salt may have long-term cons equences for the environment.

De˚nition of ph ases of targeting of hospitals
15
 
Evacuation order
: a notice from the Israeli military to leave the hospital; thes e are commonly issued 
publicly, via o˜icial s ocial media channels of the Israeli military or government bodies. Our res earch 
suggests that orders are also issued to hospitals by direct communication with healthcare workers 
at thos e hospitals.
16
 
Evacuation warning
: a notice to leave the hospital from the Israeli military through the form of a threat 
or caution, with a message that they will target the hospital with bombing if it is not evacuated. Thes e 
are issued directly to the hospital through direct communication with healthcare workers.   
17
 
Forced evacuation
: an instance when the hospital declares to evacuate due to the near proximit y of 
the Israeli military, and the danger this impos es on the medical facilit y, healthcare workers, p atients, 
and displaced people.
18
 
Attacking  surroundings
: an Israeli military attack on areas in the vicinit y of the hospital.
19
 
Direct att ack
: an Israeli military attack towards the location of a hospital and has a dire ct imp act on the 
hospital. Thi s may include the people within the hospital™s grounds and its immediate surroundings, 
as well as buildings, court yard, s olar p anels, or generators. 
20
 
Siege
: a state in which the Israeli military i s pre sent in the immediate surrounding of a hospital, 
controlling access in and out of it, while internally displaced people, injured civilians, and/or healthcare  
workers remain in the hospital.
21
 
Invasion
: a state in which the Israeli military raids and enters the hospital building or the hospital complex.

2˜
Pat tern ˚n dings 
2.1
 
The Israeli military repeatedly targeted medical infrastructure across Gaza.
(A)
 
The Israeli military™s targeting of hospitals follows a consistent and discernible pattern of ˛ve 
t ypically consecutive phases:
(a)
 
Evacuation orders and warnings (27 hospitals)
(b)
 
Attacking the surroundings of hospitals (2 9 hospitals)
(c)
 
Direct attacks on hospitals (31 hospitals)
(d )
 
Putting hospitals under siege (11 hospitals)
(e)
 
Invading hospitals (10 hospitals)
(B)
 
The Israeli military™s attacking of hospitals correlates with the advancement and presence of Israeli 
ground forces:
(a)
 
Th e ˚rst hospitals in Gaza forc ed out of service by Israeli att ack s were in areas into which 
the ground invasion ˚rst advanced 
(b)
 
The position of the Israeli ground forces correlates with where hospitals were subs equently 
forced out of s ervice
(c)
 
Whe n large hos pi tals we re atta cked by Israeli ground fo rces, small hos pi tals in the sur rounding  
area were often als o attacked and forced out of s ervice
(C)
 
Sites of medical infrastructure where healthcare services were (a) reestablished and (b) introduced 
were subsequently targeted by the Israeli military:
(a)
 
Hospitals where healthcare services reem erged endured subsequent atta cks by the 
Israeli  military
(b)
 
Field hospitals introduced to support Gaza™s healthcare system were clos ed due to Israeli 
military  conduct
2.2
 
The timing of the Israeli military™s attacks on hospitals correlates with the presence of displaced 
civilians at those hospitals
2.3
 
The Israeli military targeted medical personnel and facilities in a manner which causes damage to 
Gaza™s medical system
(A)
 
Healthcare workers have been direct targets of the Israeli military, as opposed to being indirect 
casualties of attacks on hospitals.
(B)
 
The Israeli military destroyed and occupied hospitals even after they had been forced out of service 
and evacuated.
(C)
 
The Israeli military™s targeting of hospitals caused damage to Gaza™s maternity services.
341
C˜
BACKGROUND
23
 
Widespread attacks on medical infrastructure and healthcare workers have been obs erved in every 
Israeli military campaign in Gaza s ince Ham as took power in 2007: in 2008˝0 9, the Israeli military 
damage d or destroye d 5 8 hospitals and clinics and 29 ambulances, killing 16 medical workers and 
injuring 25; in 2012, 16 hospitals and clinics and six ambulances were damaged or destroyed; in 2014, 
73 hospitals and clinics and 45 ambulances were damaged or destroyed, and 23 medical workers 
killed  and  76  inj ured.
5
24
 
The b lock ade in place sinc e 2007 limited acc ess to e ssential medicine s, medical supplies and 
equipment, while milit ary activity resulted in injuries which Gaza™s health care system had limited 
cap acit y to deal with.
6
 Restrictions on fuel and electricit y imports caus ed disruptions and led many 
hospitals and clinics to rely on generators and s olar p anels.
7
25
 
As of 2023, Gaza had 36 hospitals with a total of around 3,400 beds, and 128 primary health clinics.
8
 
The healthcare system included both public and NGO-run facilities.

AVAILABILIT Y OF EVIDENCE 
41
 
The availabilit y of visual evidence on which much of our analysis rests varies throughout the various 
phases of at tacks on hospitals (those pha ses listed above: 1) Evacuation orders and warnings 2) 
Attacking the surroundings of hospitals 3) Direct attacks on hospitals 4) Putting hospitals under siege 
5) Invading hospitals). 
42
 
T his is because the Israeli military at tacks locations surrounding a hospital, allowing civilians ins ide 
to document these incidents in video and photographs.
43
 
C ommonly, the aftermath of airstrikes on hospitals are well documented, becaus e, in the abs ence of 
military activit y on the ground, civilians are largely able to move around and us e their phones freely. 
When a hospital is ˚rst subject to ground invasion, visual evidence is still possible. People seeking 
shelter in the hospital commonly document direct attacks as far as they are able.
44
 
However, once evacuations of a hospital begins, fewer people are pres ent to record visual evidence. 
Moreover, the presence of military personnel and ongoing military activity can discourage civilians 
from documenting events.
45
 
For similar reas ons, visual evidence during the invasion phas e becomes sp ars e. Thi s is likely due to 
several factors: the detaining of civilians near military operations, the con˚scation of recording devices,  
and people™s fear of using devices in clos e proximit y to the Israeli military.
46
 
Therefore, we rel y on other forms of reporting and testimony to understand thes e moments of 
d es truc tio n. Al thou gh i t is ofte n not possibl e to ve rify re po rts as they hap pe n , w he n the Is raeli 
military withdraws f rom a ho spital, we can cro ss-referenc e repor te d acts with vi s ual evidence f rom 
the  aftermath  of  an  invasion.

The 13 October 2023 order to eva cuate the north of Gaza applied to the 23 hospitals in the region. 
The general evac uation order was made more explicit as hospit als repor tedly received phone calls 
from the Israeli military instructing them to evacuate in compliance with the order.

 The WHO declared  
this a ™death sentence™ for the s ick and the m any injured people being treated in those hosp itals for 
wounds sustained during Israel™s military campaign.

An electricity blackout in Gaza, beginning on 11 October 2023 and lasting several days, forced hospitals  
to rely on backup generators to power their equipment. The situation wors ened on 23 October, when 
none of the aid trucks entering Gaza brought fuel for generators, leaving many hospitals functioning 
at reduced cap acit y during a time of high demand for s ervices.

Groun d invasion of north of Gaza Œ from 27 October 
52
 
The ground invasion proceeded in t wo directions simultaneously. First, the Israeli military entered 
from the north, advancing south towards Gaza Cit y. Second, entering from the east and moving west 
roughly along Wadi Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea (the area that would later become the Netzarim 
corridor, see Chapter 2: Spatial Contro l) redirecting north to Gaza City. This had severe impac ts on 
the 23 hospitals in the north of Gaza, with none of the hospitals being able to function at full cap acit y. 
53
 
From the n or th, th e Israeli military entered at two locations, Be it Hanoun an d Be it Lahiya , in th e 
northwest and northeast of Gaza. This saw the reduction and closure of hospitals in these areas.
5 4
 
The second prong of the ground invasion moved east to west and then turne d north, then the two 
directions came together to envelop G aza Cit y, imp acting a region that has the highest densit y and 
number of hospitals in Gaza (17 out of 36 are within this area). 
55
 
Seven hospitals were besieged during this period:
(a)
 
A l-Q uds Hospital [Incident ID: 3110 552 971]
(b)
 
A l-Nasr Paediatric Hospital [ID: 3110715508]

Indonesian Hospital [Incident ID: 3112477291]
(c)
 
A l-Rantisi Specialized Hospital [Incident ID: 311137210 5]
5 7
 
By 23 November, only t wo of the 23 hospitals in the north of Gaza were functioning, all at a reduced 
cap acit y. The other 21 hospitals had been forced out of s ervice due to Israeli military action or a lack 
of res ources to maintain their facilities.

Cease˚re Œ 24˛30 November 
58
 
A temporary cease˚re between Israel and Hamas in Gaza was in e˜ect between 24 and 30 November 
2023.  
59
 
On the ˚rst day of the ceas e˚re, following a ˚ve- day siege, the Israeli military invaded the Indonesian 
Hos pi tal at 03:00 [Incid e nt ID: 3112477291], w i thdraw ing by mo r ning. Also o n 24 Nove mbe r, the Is raeli  
military withdrew from al-Shifa Medical C omplex following an invasion that began 15 November. 
[Incident  ID:  3112412897 ]
60
 
O n 14 November, th e GMH reported that 1,500 healthcare workers an d approxim ately 7,000 displaced  
people were inside the Shifa complex.
16
 On 10 November, prior to the Isra e li siege, up to 60,0 0 0 internally  
displaced people had been sheltering there.
17
 When the Israe li military withdrew from al- Shifa on 24 
November, about 250 healthcare workers and p atients remained in the (non- operational) complex .
18
4˜
Groun d invasion of south of Gaza Œ from 4 December 2023
61
 
Following the temporary cease˚re, hospitals in the north of Gaza continued to be attacked by the 
Israeli military. In December 2023, K amal Adwan Hospital and al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia were both 
besieged, invaded, and forced out of s ervice.
19
62
 
As the groun d invasion entered southern Gaza , it approached Khan Younis f rom two directions, 
surrounding the cit y from the s outh and east. Two hospitals in the region, Nass er Medical C omplex 
and al-Amal Hospital, endured m ul tiple sieges and inva sions between January and April 2024. Al-
Khair Hospital was als o invaded in January 2024. 
63
 
In March 2024 , al-Shifa Medical Complex was invade d for the se cond time. [Inc ident ID: 4 031808413]
5˜
Groun d invasion of Rafah Œ from 6 May 2024
6 4
 
Following the Israeli military withdrawal from Khan Youni s, the ground invasion entere d Rafah from 
Karem Abu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing. Prior to this incursion, hospitals in Rafah (Muhammad 
Youssef al-Najjar Ho spital, Kuwait Specialized Ho spital, and al-Helal al-Emarati Ho spital) were still 
functioning. However, as the Israeli military advanced east to west all these hospitals were force d 
out of s ervice, displacing civilian s in Rafah to the ‚exp anded humanitarian zone™ in al-Mawasi, which 
lacked medical infrastructure, leading to the establishment of s everal ˚eld hospitals. 
65
 
Fo llowing the formation of ˚eld hospitals in the ‚humani tarian zone™, several were impa cted by intensi˚ed  
military activit y in the vicinit y and forced thes e temporary facilities out of s ervice and to evacuate.

PAT TERN FINDINGS
1˜
The Israeli military repeatedly targeted medical infrastructure across Gaza 
1.1
 
The Israeli military™s targeting of hospitals follows a consistent and discernible pattern of ˛ve 
t ypically consecutive phases
6 9
 
Our data indicates a p attern of actions by which the Israeli military has repeatedly targeted hospitals. 
35 of the 36 hospitals in Gaza have been forced out of s ervice at one point in time bet ween 7 October 
2023 and 1 August 2024, and only 15 were p artially functioning as of 1 August 2024 (see 
Figure  
 
5.4
).  
7 0
 
O ur anal ysi s indicates that the Israeli military™s targeting of hospitals follows a con si stent and di scernible  
pattern of ˚ve typically consecuti ve phases which ultimately led to the ce s sation of fun ction at 
that hospital:
(a)
 
Evacuation  orders  and  warnings
(b)
 
Attacks on the surroundings of hospitals
(c)
 
Direct attacks on hospitals
(d )
 
Putting hospitals under siege
(e)
 
Invading hospitals
71
 
According to our analysis:
(a)
 
22 hospitals have been subject to at least three out of the ˚ve phas es
(b)
 
12 hospitals have been subject to at least four out of the ˚ve phas es
(c)
 
7 hospitals have been subject to all ˚ve of the phas es 
(A)
 
Evacuation orders and warnings
72
 
Our data shows that at least 27 hospitals in Gaza have received evacuation orders bet ween 7 October 
and 1 August 2024.
73
 
Evacuation orders exerted immense pressure on hosp itals whose capacity was already stretched by a  
signi˚cant in˘ux of p atients. In October 2023, tens of thousands of civilians s ought refuge in al- Shifa 
Medical C omplex , believing it to be the safest place in the area at that time.

On 13 Octob er, an evacuation order was i ss ue d for the entire area of G aza north of Wadi G aza.
22
 
Re portedly, 23 hos pitals in no rth Gaz a received direct ins tru c tio ns to evacuate o n the same day.
23
 The 
World Health Organization described Israeli evacuation orders on hospitals as a ‚death s entence™ for 
p atients who needed urgent care.
24
75
 
Following the 13 October evacuation order, hospitals continued to receive phone calls from the Israeli 
military ordering them to comply.
25
 Some of thes e hospitals were told they had only hours to evacuate.
26

Attacks on the surroundings of hospitals
76
 
Our data shows that the surroundings of 2 9 of the 36 hospitals were attacked by the Israeli military.
29
 
O ur analysi s of this data shows that the Israeli military repeate dl y attacked neighb ourhoods s urrounding  
hospitals. As demonstrate d below, attacking the vicinit y of a hospital often caus ed major disruptions 
for the hospital due to a s udden in˘ux of patients, halting movement and acce ssibility for sta˜ and 
ambulances, and disrupting the delivery of medical supplies due to the danger pos ed to pers onnel. 
Attacks on the immediate surrounding s of hospitals often followed eva cuation warning s to hospital sta˜.

Our data indicates that 31 of the 36 hospitals across Gaza have been subject to attac ks by the Israeli 
militar y since Oc to be r 2023 . Many of these hos pi tals were attacked af te r they bec ame s hel te r s fo r 
thou sand s of displa ced people. Al-Shifa Medical Complex was struck by airstr ikes when around 60,000 
were sheltering there.
40
  Nass er Me dical C omplex was struck when 30,000 people were sheltering 
there.
41
  The Indonesian Hospital had 20,000 di splaced pe ople,
42
 al-Quds had 14,000,
43
 and Kamal 
Adwan sheltered 7,000 displaced people when they were directly attacked.
44
(a)
 
Fo ll owing eva cuation order s and the repeated targeting of i ts sur rounding s, Kamal Adwan 
Hospital was dire ctly targete d on 18 Novemb er 2023 when an artillery shell struck the children™s

2023.  [Incident  ID:  3120 5 66186]
(b)
 
Al-Shifa Medical Compl ex was ˚rst directly targ eted on 3 N ovember, when an Isra eli airs tr ike 
hit an ambulance convoy, killing ˚ fteen people and injuring sixt y others. [Incident ID: 31103-
44745] The hospital was subsequently directly attac ked six more times (see footnote 40). 
These attacks struck the hospital™s court yard, where civilians were sheltering, as well as its 
maternit y building, outpatient ward, and emergency department.
79
 
Commonl y, c ivilian s sheltering within hospital grounds have live d in tents in the courtyards of 
the complex, or in hallways, stairwell corridors , or storage closets.
45
 This repurposing of medical 
environments as shelters has reportedly led to an increas e in infections.

Our dat a indicates that 11 of 36 hosp ital s acros s Gaza have been subject to siege by th e I sraeli 
military since October 2023.  When the Israeli military places a hospital under siege, it maintain s an 
arme d pre sence in the imme diate surroundings and control the acc ess of people and s upplies. We 
have observed the following consequences on hospitals, healthcare workers, and displaced civilians 
working  there:
(a)
 
Disruption  to  medical  function
(b)
 
Obstruction  of  access  to  aid
(c)
 
Burial of deceas ed p atients to occur in makeshift cemeteries in hospital grounds

During its sieges on hospi tals, the Israeli mili tar y ha s re p eatedly restric ted the entry of medic al 
equipment, medicine, and fuel needed to run its generators for electricit y.
84
 
Fuel for generators was necessary for thes e hospitals due to the restriction of electricity supply, and 
the  destruction  of  electrical  infrastructure  (s ee  Chapter  6:  Destruction  of  Civilian  Infrastructure)

On 16 February 2024, the day after the Israeli military invaded the hospital, following a siege 
that be gan on 2 2 January [Inc ident ID: 4012 267070], a UNRWA mi ssion was unable to deliver

Invading hospitals

O ur data indicates that 10 of the 36 hospitals
 
across G aza have b een subject to ground invasion by 
the Israeli military since October 2023.
95
 
T hese invasions have commonly entailed interruption to the functioning of the hospitals and structural 
damage to hospital buildings.
96
 
C ivilians rem aining after the evacuations during the siege often comprise patients too injured to be 
transported, along with healthcare workers.
97
 
After the Israeli military entered ho spitals, healthcare workers
 
have be en detaine d, fur ther dismantling  
what remains of the hospital™s healthcare system. This removal of pers onnel, along with the frequent 
damage  to  facilities,
54
 threatened the lives of civilians s eeking care, often resulting in multiple deaths 
during a hospital invasion.

The Israeli military™s attacking of hospitals correlates with the advancement and presence of Israeli 
ground forces
98
 
We analys e d the relationship bet ween when hospitals across G aza re duced their function, or went 
out of s ervice, and the progress of the Israeli ground invasion. This analysis suggests three p atterns:
(a)
 
Hospitals that were ˚rst forced out of s ervice due to attacks by the Israeli military were in the 
same areas where the ground invasion ˚rst advanced.
(b)
 
The p osition of the Is raeli ground forces correlates to where hospi tals were subsequently 
forced out of s ervice
(c)
 
The advancement of the Israeli military accelerated the phas es of targeting for small hospitals  
Œ forcing them out of service.
(A)
 
The ˛rst hospitals in Gaza forced out of service by Israeli attacks were in areas into which the 
ground invasion ˛rst advanced 
(a)
 
On 9 October 2023, B eit Hanoun Hospital was s everely damaged by bombings, forcing the 
hospital out of s ervice. [Incident ID: 310 09 74237 ] The hospital is the most northern facilit y 
in Gaza 2 km from the northern border of Gaza, in the municip alit y of B eit Hanoun.
(b)
 
On 15 October 2023 , Sheikh Hama d Hospital was seve rely damaged by air str ikes. It was late r 
evacuated. [Incid e nt ID: 3101535056] The hos pital is in the municipali ty of Jabalia, 6.2 km 
from the northern border of Gaza.
(c)
 
On 17 October 2023, al-K arama Specialized Hospital was s everely damaged and forced out 
of service. [Incident ID:
 
3 101739971] T he hospital is in the municipality of Jab alia, 5.8 km 
from the northern border of Gaza.
99
 
T he ground invasion commenced on 27 October thro ugh Beit Lahia and Beit Hano un, with the military 
advancing towards Sheikh Hamad Hospital and B eit Hanoun Hospital. 
Figure  
 
5.28
 shows the areas 
the Israeli military ˚rst invaded. By removing essential medical facilities and basic s ervices, the military  
s ought to force populations in thes e areas to relocate. 
100
 
Our analysis suggests that targeting thes e hospitals s erved as a tool for displacing Palestinians and 
facilitated the ground invasion into Gaza. This is evident from 
Figure  
 
5.29
 showing the Israeli military 
ground invasion on 1 November an d th e areas it would ad van ce into, areas over an d n ear the three 
hospitals that were ˚rst forced out of s ervice. 
101
 
As the Israeli military invaded north Gaza, it sim ultaneously entered through the Netzarim corridor, 
where the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital is located. On 30 October 2023, while the ground 
invasion forces were stationed along Salah-al-Din Road approximately 2.3 km away from the hospital, 
the facilit y was targeted by an Israeli airstrike (s ee 
Figure  
 
5.28
). [Incident ID: 3103094975]
389
102
 
Following this incident, the hospital (the only specialis ed cancer hospital in Gaza) was forced out of 
s ervice on 1 November 2023 and evacuated.
60
 Photographs posted on 9 November 2023 (s ee 
Figure  
 
5.27
) shows the hospital to have sustained s evere destruction by the Israeli military. 
103
 
On 1 November 2023, the same day it went out of service, the Israeli military had advanced to 500 m 
from the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital. 
104
 
O n 22 February 2024, a video emerged of an Israeli soldier bulldozing areas inside the Turkish-
Pale stinian Frien dship H ospit al . [In cident ID: 4022257565] The I sraeli milit ary eventually used th e 
hos pi tal as a mili tary base (see Sectio n: The Is raeli militar y des troyed and o c cupied hos pi tals eve n 
after they had been forced out of s ervice and evacuated). [Incident ID: 40 51249194]
105
 
By examining the locations of hospitals that were forced to clos e and evacuate, alongside the ground 
invasion and occup ation of the Netzarim corridor, our analysis suggests that, like the three hospitals 
in the north, the targeting of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital was due to it being in an area 
where the ground invasion would advance (see 
Figure  
 
5.30
).

Our analysis of incidents (bel ow) w he re and w he n larg e hos pi tals we re fo rced out of se r v ice in relatio n 
to th e movement of Israeli groun d forces suggests that the advan cement of the I sraeli military towards  
hospitals closely related to the phases of targeting.
107
 
Of the 17 hospitals in the municip alit y of Gaza Cit y, six small hospitals were forced out of s ervice prior 
to the ground invasion reaching Gaza Cit y.
(a)
 
St John Eye Hospital was forced out of s ervice at the beginning of Israel™s military camp aign, 
with its healthcare workers moving to the s outh of Gaza. [Incident ID: 3100710 564]

108
 
Following the Israeli military™s incursion from the northwest of Gaza and thro ugh the Net zarim corridor,  
Isra e li ground forces entered the municipality of Gaza City on 7 November 2023 (see 
Figure 
 
5. 30
),  
advancing through Sheik h Hamad Hospital, a small, specialised hospital whic h had been forced 
out of service prior. At that point 11 ho spitals were operational, though all exc ept two, Pub lic Aid Œ 
Cardiovascular Hospital and Assahaba Medical C omplex , were functioning at reduced cap acit y.
109
 
By the time the Israeli military withdrew during the temporary ceas e˚re on 24 November 2023, 10 of 
thes e hospitals had been forced out of s ervice at s ome point bet ween 7 October and the beginning 
of the temporary ceas e˚re. Seven of thes e hospitals were besiege d, of which t wo were subs equently 
invaded by the Israeli military. The three other hospitals were forced out of s ervice. 
1 10
 
The siege and invasion of the s even hospitals mentioned above correlates with the position of Israeli 
gro und forces (see 
Figure 
 
5.31
). For example, as th e ground invas ion advanced to al-Quds Hosp ital 
on 12 November 2023 (s ee 
Figure  
 
5.32
), the hospital was evacuated becaus e of direct attacking by 
the Israeli military. Subsequently, the facility was forced out of service. [Incident ID: 3111271864]
111
 
For th e two hospitals that were invaded, al-Rantis i Specialized Hospital an d al-Shifa M edical Complex,  
as the ground invasion advanced towards thes e hospitals the phas es of siege and invasion began.

This analysis shows that the complete, phas ed destruction of a hospital Œ involving its invasion by the 
Israeli military while occupied by healthcare workers, injured individuals, and displaced people Œ was 
dependent on the pres ence of a ground invasion force.

The Israeli military ground invasion advanced into Khan Younis in late 2023, causing the reduction of 
medical service at al-Amal Hospital [Incident ID : 4013 037584] and Nasser Medical Complex [Incident  
ID: 40215776 9 9] between January and March 2024, due to multiple s ieges and invas ions , before 
both were forced out of s ervice. A l-Khair Hospital was als o invaded in January 2024.
1 14
 
In May 2024, as the Israeli military entered Rafah, advancing from K arem A bu Salem/Kerem Shalom 
crossing, hospitals from east to west were s ubse quentl y attacke d and forced out of service as the 
ground invasion moved across Gaza, demonstrated in 
Figure

On 7 May 2024, the day after the Israeli military o˜ensive on Rafah began from the Karem A bu Salem/
Kerem Shalom crossing (s e e

When large hospitals were attacked by the Israeli ground forces, small hospitals in the surrounding 
area were often also attacked and forced out of service 
1 17
 
We analys ed incidents at three small hospitals which were functioning at varying cap acities prior to 
the Israeli incursion into Gaza Cit y on 2 November 2023:
(a)
 
A l-Helou International Hospital 
(b)
 
Wafaa Medical Rehabilitation and Specialized Surgery Hospital 
(c)
 
Public  Aid  Œ  Cardiovascular  Hospital  
1 18
 
We have observed a pattern that when large hospitals are attac ked, small hospitals in the surrounding 
area are often als o attacked and forced out of s ervice. 
1 19
 
The siege of al- Shifa Medical C omplex , a large hospital, which began on 11 November 2023 [Incident 
ID: 3111100049] and the subs equent invasion on 15 November [Incident ID:
 
311155 9237 ],  coincided  
with the closing of al-Helou International Hospital on 16 November 2023, a small hospital located 250 
m from al- Shifa. [Incident ID: 3111621034] 
1 20
 
On 12 November 2023, the Israeli military advanced southeast from the area near the Patient™s Friends 
Society Hospital towards al-Ahli Arab Hospital (see 
Figure 
 
5.36
), which they wo uld besiege on 16 
November 2023. [ID : 3111693455] Along this route taken by the military were two small hospitals, 
Wafa a Medical Reh abilitation and Specialized Surgery Hospital and Public Aid Œ C ardiovascular 
Hosp ital. B oth hosp ital s were forced out of service between 12 November and 18 November 2023, 
as the Israeli military advanced towards and maintained a pres ence around al-A hli A rab Hospital (s ee 
Figure  
 
5.37
). In this period Wafaa Hospital su˜ered s evere damage from Israeli military activit y, with 
tanks visible around the hospital. [Incident ID: 3111375064] The Public A id Œ Cardiovascular Hospital 
was als o targeted by a bombing. [Incident ID: 3111391332]
1 21
 
Our analysis of the above incidents suggests that multiple hospitals in a single area were attacked in 
clos e succession.

4062624979], after large p arts of it were renovated to restore medical function. [Incident ID : 
40712002 90] On 8 July, the Israeli military issued evacuation warnings in Gaza Cit y, where 
the hospital was located, resulting in the eva cuation of 30 patients. [Incident ID : 4070 875402]  
Five days later the hospital was attacked and destroyed by the Israeli military for the s econd

Following the invasion of Kamal Adwan Hospital (13 D ecember 2023) and al-Awda Hospital Œ 
Jabalia (17 December), both hospitals were forced out of s ervice.
64
 After regaining functionalit y  
between January and April 2024, on 16 May, the Isra e li military advanced towards Jabalia, 
around K amal Adwan Hospital and al-Awda Hospital (s ee 
Figure  
 
5.39
). Both were forced out 
of s ervice again, due to a siege by the Israeli military on 24 May at K amal Adwan Hospital and 
1 9 May at al-Awda Hospital (see 
Figure 
 
5.40
. Al-Awda Hospital was subsequently invaded 
on 22 M ay.
65
 This series of incident s suggest that the I sraeli milit ary ground invasion was 
directed towards K amal Adwan Hospital and al-Awda Hospital Œ Jabalia.

Field hospitals introduced to support Gaza™s healthcare system were closed due to Israeli military 
conduct
1 24
 
As hospitals were forced out of service by Israeli military conduct, ˚eld hospitals were established. 
In total, 13 ˚eld hospitals have operated in Gaza.
66
 12 of 13 ˚eld hospitals were in the s outh of Gaza, 
with six located in Rafah and ˚ ve in Khan Younis. Four of the six located in Rafah were established 
bet ween December 2023 and May 2024: the UAE Field Hospital (December 2023),
67
 A l-Quds  Field  
Hos pi tal (Fe bruar y 2024),

By May 2024, Gaza™s healthcare system had been incap acitated by the Israeli military, leading to the"
Displacement,,introduction
Displacement,,"of thes e ˚eld hospitals due to the absence of, and need for, healthcare s ervices in Gaza.
71
 
In Rafah, ˚eld hospitals were established to especially s erve the in˘ux of displace d c ivilians who had 
˘ed to the south of Gaz a (see Chapter 3: Dis placeme nt). Follow ing the Israeli military™s inva sio n of 
R afah on 6 May, two ˚eld hospitals were opened in al-Mawasi to serve the civilian population that 
had been displaced to there once again.
72
1 26
 
Af te r the invasio n of Rafah o n 6 May, four of the ˚el d hos pi tals in the regio n we re fo rced ou t of se r v ice. 
As the military advanced towards areas where ˚eld hospitals were located, we obs erved a correlation 
between the advancement of the Israeli military and ˚eld hospitals being forced out of service.
73
 T his is  
the cas e even when the military™s position is moving in the direction of but has not yet reached the ˚eld  
hospital (Rafah Indonesian Field Hospital), due to the risk pos ed on healthcare workers and p atients 
(s ee 
Figure  
 
5.42

74
 The closure of these ˚e ld hospitals corre lated with the movement of the Israe li 
mili tar y ground invasion , su ccessively forcing these fa cilities ou t of se r vice as i t advanced fro m Kare m 
A bu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing towards the coast. This is evident in

Displacement,,conclusion
Displacement,,"1 28
 
This analysi s reveals a long-term p attern of targeting hospitals across Gaza. The attacks exhibit three 
key characteristics: 1) repetition, evidenced by the number of hospitals targeted by the Israeli military, 
2) c onsis te ncy, s how n throu gh the sus tained number of attacks o n mul tipl e hospi tals in di˜e re nt 
locations over an extended time perio d, 3) form, demonstrated by the ˚ve -phase pattern we observed 
in the targeting of hospitals. 
1 2 9
 
This p attern of targeting hospitals is supported by the repeatedly obs erved correlation bet ween the 
attacks on hospitals and the advancement and pres ence of Israeli ground forces. 
130
 
Th e continuation of att acks on h o spit al s that ree st ablish ed h ealth care services an d ˚eld h ospit als 
demonstrate s a persistent targeting of G aza™s healthcare system , reinforcing evidenc e that medical 
infrastructure in Gaza was targeted by the Israeli military.

2˜
The timing of the Israeli military™s attacks on hospitals correlates with the presence of displaced 
civilians at those hospitals
131
 
We analysed th e relationship between th e timin g of I srael™s att acks on six h osp ital s with th e documented  
pres ence of civilians within them. The six hospitals we examined are:
(a)
 
A l- Shifa Medical C omplex
(b)
 
Nass er Medical C omplex
(c)
 
A l-A mal Hospital 
(d )
 
A l-Q uds Hospital
(e)
 
K amal Adwan Hospital
(f)
 
A l-Rantisi Specialized Hospital
132
 
For each hospital, we plotted on a timeline: the data pertaining to attacks on that hospital captured in 
the GCD; the state of s ervice of the hospital (in s ervice, reduced functioning, or out of s ervice); if, and 
when, the hospital had faced a sie ge or invasion; and any information captured about the number of 
displaced civilians sheltering there over time.
75
133
 
The attacks we plotted in this analysis are what we categoris ed as ‚direct attacks™ and ‚attacking the 
surroundings of hospitals™ (see Section: Methodology).
13 4
 
Figure 
 
5.46
 shows a table of the hospitals we analysed, inc lu ding the total number of atta cks d ocumented 
and the highest recorded number of displaced civilians sheltering there. 
Figure

, 
Figure  5.48
, and 
Figure  5.49
 show the distribution of thes e ˚gures over time. The timelines demonstrate that attacks 
on e ach of these ho spitals were mo st f requent at the height of the displac ed ci vilian population 
sheltering there. By cross-referencing the highest recorded number of displaced civilians sheltering 
at each hosp ital with the total number of at tacks each hosp ital faced, we observed that the greater 
the number of displaced civilians at a given hospital, the greater the number of attacks by the Israeli 
military on that hospital.

The t wo hospitals that have sheltered the highest populations: al- Shifa Medical C omplex , which at its

76
 
These hospitals have endured the highest number of attacks (se e

Other hospitals sheltered thousands of people, such as al-Rantisi Specialized Hospital (6 ,000), and 
have experien c ed fewer att acks.

 Alth ough Kamal Adwan has sheltered fewer people than larger 
hospitals (7,000),

A l-Shifa Medical C omplex
139
 
One example where displaced people correlates to attacks on hospitals is al- Shifa Medical C omplex. 
The hospital population of internally displaced people inc reased in al-Shifa Medical Complex in 
O ctober 2023. The area surrounding al-Shifa Medical C omplex was targeted with aerial bombardment  
as early as 9 October, [ID: 3100983107] with a mass evacuation order for the nor th of G aza i ssue d 
on 13 October. By 23 October, the United Nations O˜ice for the C oordination of Humanitarian A˜airs 
(OCHA) reported 45,000 internally displaced people were sheltering in the hospital at that time. 
140
 
On the 10 November, the GMH rep orted that 60,000 displaced p eople were sheltering in the hospital. 
In the early hours of that day, al- Shifa Medical C omplex was attacked four times by the Israeli military 
(s ee Section: A ppendix : al- Shifa Medical C omplex Œ Visual Cas e Study for visual evidence):

09:16 ˝ Outp atient clinic [Incident ID: 3111025697 ]
141
 
Following the direct attack on al- Shifa Medical C omplex , civilians left the complex in large numbers. 
OCHA reported that by 11 November, only 15,0 00 people remained she ltering in the facility.
80
 On 
14 November, the day before the invasion, reports indicated that 7,000 displaced people and 1,500 
healthcare workers remained within al- Shifa Medical C omplex .
81
 B et ween 11 and 14 November, while 
al-Shifa was under siege, 6,500 civilians who were sheltering at the hospital had ˘ed. This dem onstrates  
how the siege on the hospital had steadily depopulated the facilit y and displaced its occup ants.
142
 
The Israeli military™s ˚rst invasion of al- Shifa Medical C omplex ended on the ˚rst day of the temporary 
cease˚re, 24 Novembe r. OCHA re p o rted an es timated 250 patie nts and heal thc are wo r ke r s re mained at  
al-Shifa Medic al Co mp lex, w hich s hows the ˚nal p hase of d es truc tio n almos t c o mp l etely de po pulated

Our analysis demonstrates that the 
timing of the Israeli military™s attacks on hospitals correlates with 
the presence of displaced civilians at those hospitals. 
We obser ve the greater the numbe r of dis pla ced  
civilians at a hospital, the greater the number of attacks by the Israeli military on that hospital.

The Israeli military targeted medical personnel an d facilities in a m anner th at causes dam age to 
Gaza™s medical system
146
 
Our analysis of attacks on all a sp ects of medical infra structure, including healthcare workers, suggests:  
(a)
 
Healthcare workers have been direct targets of the Israeli military, as oppos ed to being indirect  
casualties of attacks on hospitals. 
(b)
 
The Israeli military destroyed and occupied hospitals even after they had been forced out of 
service and evacuated.
(c)
 
The Israeli military™s targeting of hospitals caus ed damage to Gaza™s maternit y s ervices.

Healthcare workers have been direct targets of the Israeli military, as opposed to being indirect 
casualties of attacks on hospitals.

We analysed the relationship between the timing and position of hospitals being depopulated and 
forced out of s ervice, due to Israeli military targeting, and the continued destruction and occup ation 
of thes e medical facilities. Our analysis in the following cas e studies suggests hospitals that had been

Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital
155
 
After four direct attac ks on the Turk ish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, and a shortage of utilities 
caus ed by the broader siege of humanitarian supplies, this medical facilit y was forced out of s ervice. 
Patients were subs equently evacuated on 24 December to three hospitals: al-Aqsa Mart yrs Hospital, 
Nass er Medical C omplex , and Muhammad Youss ef al-Najjar Hospital.

On 6 May 2024, after the Israeli ground invasion advanced into Rafah from K arem A bu Salem/Kerem 
Shalom crossing, in the following weeks as the military a dvanced in Rafah, three hospi tals in the 
region (Muhammad Youssef al-Najjar Hospital, Kuwait S p ecialized Hospital, and the al-Helal al-Emarati  
Hospital) were all forced out of s ervice.
16 4
 
Following orders from the Israeli military to evacuate Kuwait Specialized Hospital, two healthcare 
workers were killed on 28 May by an airstrike at the gate of the hospital. [Incident ID: 40 52894766] 
The hospital was forced out of s ervice and evacuated.

). The roads outside the facilit y and the buildings of the hospital are s een 
to be relatively undamaged.
166
 
On 3 Augu st 2024, the Kuwait Specialized Hospital posted an ima ge on the hospital™s Fa cebook 
pa ge (see

) with the caption: ‚ The Isra eli occupation destroys large parts of the Kuwait 
Specialized Hospital in Rafah Governorate.™ In the image, a cluster of buildings appear to be s everely 
damaged. A roof appears damaged, and a s olar p anel has been destroyed. The surrounding area of 
the hospital is covered in debris.
167
 
Geolocating the video from 28 M ay an d comparin g it to th e sub sequent image clearly sh ows that both  
depict the same area. Key features include the hospital entrance, a cluster of smaller buildings northwest  
of the c ourtyard, and two larg e buil dings eas t and sou th of the c ourtyard . One of these buil dings 
displays the word s ‚Kuwai t Speciality Hos pital™ o n its fa c a de when viewed from the c ourtyard entrance.
168
 
C omp aring the t wo pieces of media suggests that the hospital was destroyed bet ween 28 May, the 
date of the evacuation, an d 3 August . From as sess ing satellite imagery of Kuwait Specialized Hosp ital,  
it is evident the hospital was s everely damaged between 18 and 23 June.
97
 Substantial damage of the 
area surrounding the hospital strongly suggests the pres ence of the Israeli military in this time period. 
16 9
 
During this period, Rafah had been depopulated by the Israeli military™s ground invasion, displacing 
civilians to other areas in Gaza, p articularly al-Mawasi.

The Israeli military™s targeting of hospitals caused damage to Gaza™s maternity services
17 0
 
We analysed the re lationship between the Isra eli military™s targeting of hospitals and the impa ct on 
maternit y s ervices in Gaza. From this analysis we have obs erved:
(a)
 
Maternity wards and sp ecialist maternity hospitals have been directly attacked by the 
Israeli  military.
(b)
 
The Israeli military™s o˜ensive in Gaza has forced the closure of maternit y s ervices.
171
 
Our data shows that the Israeli military has repeatedly targeted m aternity wards and specialist m aternity  
hospitals. Thes e attacks, alongside the existing strain on hospitals due to the sharp inc rease of 
patients since the Israeli military campaign began, have cau sed long-term damage to Gaza™s maternity  
services. We anal yse d the attacks on maternity s ervices by organising the numb er of attacks on 
hospitals according to the services they provide. We also anal yse d the details of each attack on 
hospitals with maternit y wards to ass ess whether there was evidence of a p attern of directly targeting 
maternit y s ervices.

Damage to maternit y services in Gaza
172
 
T he at tacks on maternity wards , specialist maternity hospitals as well as hospitals with maternity 
wards ha s caused severe dis ruptio n to the provision of these se rv ices. Al ongsid e these direct attacks, 
hospitals have repeatedly reported needing to shut down their maternity departments due to the 
immense pre ssure on their emergency department s cause d by a large s urge of c i vilian patients 
wounded in the Israeli military camp aign. For instance, by 13 October, Nass er Medical C omplex had 
declared it had run out of beds and was operating at double cap acit y.
100
 
173
 
The provision of maternit y s ervices has been further disrupted by the restriction of aid (s ee Chapter 
7: Targeting of A id). The restriction of aid entering Gaza and reaching hospitals (s ee Section: Putting 
hospitals under s iege) has meant a shortage of necessary medical materials , medicine, and equipment,  
including diagnostic testing, sterile supplies, and hand soap, a s well a s ba sic necessities such a s fuel for  
power generators.
10 1
 Water has also been directly disrupted by the atta cks on cr itical infrastructure (see  
Chapter 6: Destr uction of Civilian Infrastr ucture) an d by th e restriction of its ˘ow (see report Appen dix).
174
 
The abilit y to access clean water has a p articularly s evere imp act on pregnant women, since water is 
important for supp orting the life of the foetus and maintaining hygiene to prevent ailments that can 
cause birth complications . Hospitals where maternity services were available changed frequently 
over the course of the con˘ict, which caused distress for women trying to remain clo se to servic e s 
towards the end of their pregnancy.
102
 
175
 
By 3 November, Na sser Medical Complex announced it had begun op erating at minimal levels of 
m edical serv ices. This was du e to a severe shorta ge of m edical supplies and fuel, c oupled w ith an 
increasing number of wounded and hospitalis ed p atients.
103
176
 
These demands and lack of services l ed to the sacri˚ ce of departments and services to cop e with 
the pressure of em ergency m edical treatment. Across Gaza, this has ha d a signi˚cant impact on 
the function of maternity services . D ue to this pressure at Nasser Medical Complex, the complex 
announced on 16 Novemb er that it had repurpose d some maternity wards and intensi ve care unit s 
into rooms for the wounded. [ID: 3111627844] They stated this would negatively imp act their cap acit y 
to accommodate c hildb irth cas es. In the hospitals that remained functioning, maternity services were 
cut to a minim um, facilitating only the birth of babies . Women had to travel home immediately after 
giving birth with no post-partum care. For women who aren™t pregnant, there are also no routine 
gynaecological  appointments,  fertilit y  or  contraception  support.

Dr Walid A bu Hatab, director of al-Tahrir Hospital for Women and Childbirth, which is p art of Nass er 
Medical Complex, described the situation as particularly severe due to the large numbers of Palestinians  
already displaced from northern Gaza, including many pregnant women seeking services.
105
 As of  
mid-November 2023, Dr A bu Hatab said, ‚More than 50,000 pregnant women in the Gaza Strip lack 
primary care  and  childbirth  s ervices.™
178
 
This issue is further exacerbated as p atients must be transferred from hospitals under attack, placing 
ad ditional strain o n Gaz a™s medical infra struc ture. This wa s evid ent in Nove mbe r 2023 w hen hospitals 
in n orthern Gaza were targeted by the I sraeli milit ary, n ec es sit ating th e transfer of patients to south ern  
hospitals. Over three cons ecutive days, from 24 November 2023, Nass er Medical C omplex received 
p atients from the Indonesian Hospital [Incident ID: 31124985 72], al- Shifa Me dical C omplex [Incident 
ID: 3112592222], and K amal Adwan Hospital. [Incident ID: 3112603500]
179
 
The eliminatio n of these se r v ices fo rced mate r ni ty patie nts to be transfe r red to othe r hos pi tals that 
could accommodate them. Even before November, al-Helou Hospital had absorb e d and replaced 
al- Shifa Medical C omplex™s maternit y ward, which had been repurpos ed to treat wounded people.
106
180
 
Similarly, on 6 November, th e h ospit al director of al-Aqsa Martyrs H osp it al ann o un ced that th e maternity  
(gynaecology) department would clos e and tran sfer s ervices to al-Awda Hospital in Nus eirat due to 
the  large in˘ux  of  wounded p atients.
107
181
 
Nevertheless, even when maternity patients have been transfe rred to hospitals that could take in 
pre gnant women, these hospitals are still a˜e cte d by the sie ge of humanitarian aid in G aza. Onl y a 
month after taking over al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital™s maternity servic es, on 2 De cember al-Awda in 
Nuseirat de clare d it was at risk of shutting down after exhausting the fuel use d for generators and 
ambulances, risking the closure of the main maternit y provider in central Gaza at that time.
108
182
 
Likewise, on 20 D ecember the only functional maternity hospital in north Gaza, Assahaba Medical 
Complex, was at risk of having to reduc e it s servic es, as fuel could not be delivered due to the insecurity  
of the area during that period.

Gaza™s medical system Œ"
Displacement,,conclusion
Displacement,,"184
 
This analysis reveals a p attern of attacks on healthcare workers, facilities, and s ervices that suggests 
a deliberate attempt to caus e damage to Gaza™s medical system with possible long-term e˜ects. The 
attacks are clustered aro und several strands of healthcare in Gaza: 1) healthcare workers, who have been  
targeted during the phas es of destruction of hospitals and outside of hospitals, 2) maternit y s ervices, 
which have been directly targeted by the Israeli military, both maternit y hospitals and dep artments, 3) 
the occup ation and destruction of hospitals after the depopulation of displaced civilians, the injured, 
and healthcare workers. 
185
 
The attacks on healthcare across several elements of its infrastructure, across multiple incidents, 
demonstrates a widespread p attern of destruction to Gaza™s healthcare system. The combination and 
re p etitio n of these for ms of attack by the Is raeli military su gg ests the targeting of medic al infra s tru cture  
is not accidental. The attacks target both the physical and s ocial elements of healthcare, suggesting 
an e˜ort to destroy medical infrastructure in Gaza. The targeting of healthcare workers, s ervices, and 
facilities across Gaza pos es long-term imp acts through the elimination of a skilled workforce, access 
to healthcare, and the physical infrastructure that provides healthcare.

Testimony on the targeting of hospitals
186
 
Below is the testimony of MB, a m an who was arrested on 18 March at al-Shifa Medical Complex, 
where he had been for t wo months with his injured wife. MB™s wife had been injured when the family 
home in al-D araj was shelled. MB was detained for 57 days . For the duration of this time, his family 
thou ght he had been kill ed. This tes timo ny was s hared w ith FA by the Pal es tinian NGO al-Haq. 
According to MB™s testimony:
(a)
 
T he Israeli military invaded al-Shifa Medical Complex at 02:00 on 18 March. T hey used 
loudspeakers to instruct everyone in side the hospital to stay where they were until they 
received additional instructions from the military. 
(b)
 
MB was on the fourth ˘oor of the emergency building. Hi s room looke d out at the eastern 
gate of the hospital. He felt it was dangerous. A long with many other people on that ˘oor, he 
hid  in  the  corridor.
(c)
 
The military invaded the dialysis dep artment ˚rst and forced people out of the building ˚ve 
at a time and arrested s ome of them.
(d )
 
At sunset , the mili tary used the lou d speake rs to ins tru ct eve ryone on the fourth ˘oo r to go 
to the courtyard. Between 40 to 5 0 men were held under the marquee in the centre of the 
main  court yard.  
(e)
 
While the men were held there, the military would call them for identi˚cation, ˚ve at a time. 
Some were told to leave, and s ome were instructed to stay. It was not clear to MB what the 
logic was, whether the military had inte lligence or if it was based on the arbitrary decision 
of the o˜icer in charge. 
(f)
 
MB was among the group the military in structe d to stay. He was told to step outside the 
marquee and ordered to take his clothes o˜ while s oldiers pointed guns at him. 
(g)
 
This happen ed at aroun d 21: 00 to 21:30, and it was rainin g wh en he stood out side th e marquee.  
(h)
 
Later he was taken to the outp atient building. The s oldiers asked the men for their ID cards 
and scanned their eyes. Later, with a group of other detainees, he was taken to a room inside 
the building, where he was blindfolded and handcu˜ed. Detainees were kept on their knees 
until the early mor ning of the following day. MB realised it wa s the next morning when he 
sensed light from underneath the blindfold.
(i)
 
In the e arly hours of 19 March, the detainee s were loaded onto a truck, ‚similar to truck s 
u sed to transfer animals™, a ccording to MB. The detainees were taken in the direction of 
Nabulsi roundabout, and later outsid e Gaza. Some of the detainees were injured patients 
from the hospital.
(j)
 
Until the detainees reached the prison, they were beaten and insulted. MB was beaten with 
a baton on his head. He was asked: ‚Why were you in al-Shifa Medical C omplex? Why was 
your home bombed? How come your wife was injured? ™

A doctor™s account regarding ˛eld hospitals
˙
187
 
This testimo ny was co ll ec ted by an al-Haq researcher in Se pte mber 2024, who inte rv iewed a d oc to r in 
Gaza about the state of ˚e ld hospitals. This doctor is a member of the Supreme Emergency Committee  
in the Palestinian Ministry of Health. 
188
 
Res earcher: First, we are from al-Haq Human Rights Organisation, and we™d like to get a testimony 
regarding the ˚eld hospitals and the map claim made by the Israeli military, which mention s over 
t went y ˚eld hospitals in the Mawasi area. To begin, can you tell us your full name?
 
189
 
Doctor: I am Dr. X, former director of X Hospital, currently the X of Field Hospitals at the Palestinian 
Ministry of Health, and a member of the Supreme Emergency C ommittee in the Palestinian Ministry 
of Health.
 
190
 
Doctor: Regarding the question, the Israeli military™s map is one with a purpos e and a goal. The Israeli 
occup ation wants to appear as if it is supporting us with medical teams, ˚eld hospitals, and medical 
centres, while in realit y, it is the one killing our people, destroying hospitals, damaging infrastructure, 
and ruining medical centres and ˚eld hospitals. The number of ˚eld hospitals is not as claimed by the 
Israeli occup ation. Thes e 20 are a mix of hospitals, clinics, and medical elite teams. First, the UKMID 
hospitals in the central area, as claimed by the Israeli occup ation, are merely medical points that don™t 
even qualify as clinics. Only t wo are functional, and the third is not operational. A ls o, the ˚eld hospital 
a˜iliated w i th UKMID in the sou ther n Gaz a Str ip, betwee n Rafah and Khan Younis, barely quali˚es 
as a polyclinic an d n ot a h ospital due to th e lack of full services Œ n o laboratory equipment, n o CT 
scans, no MRIs, and as I mentioned, even weak X-ray s ervices. Additionall y, the hospital™s operation 
rooms, and inp atient facilities are below standard, so it cannot be called a ˚eld hospital but rather an 
advanced clinic.
 
19 1
 
Researcher : Can we say that there are twelve ˚eld hospitals in the central and so uthern areas we 
know  of?
 
192
 
Doctor: Not even that. At most, if we cons ider what we have, there are between three an d ˚ve h ospitals.  
But in terms of real functionalit y and operations on the ground, there are three ˚eld hospitals.
 
 
193
 
First, the Jordanian ˚eld hospital near Nass er Hospital is a ˚eld hospital, but it lacks a CT scan, has 
limited bed capacity, an d lacks specialties that we need in th e Gaza Strip. Neverth eles s, it rece ives 
p atients, conducts outp atient s ervices, and performs surgeries. Some things are missing, but the lab 
and  X-ray s ervices  are  available,  though  without  a  CT  scan.
 
 
194
 
In addition, there™s the Red Cross ˚eld hospital in al- Mawasi, Rafah, which operates as outpatient 
clinics an d has two surgery rooms alon g with a port ab le X-ray machin e , th ough with out protection 
from radiation. Recently, s ome lab equipment was added, and the Red Cross ˚eld hospital operates 
with its full capa city. It has 50 ˝60 inpatient bed s, inc luding four obstetr ics bed s and 15 paediatr ic 
beds. This is the Red Cross ˚eld hospital.
 
 
195
 
T here™s also the Jordanian hospital, along with the Emirati ˚eld hospital in R afah, which has all 
sp ecialties, including orthopaedics and surgery, and it ha s X-rays and CT, though the CT does not 
have a printer. This hospital was us ed during its time in Rafah, but after the Israeli occup ation entered 
440
Rafah, it b ecame inaccessible and is now ‚non-functional™. Therefore, we need to reactivate it, and for 
the Israeli occ upation to le ave Rafah so that this hospital can provide servic es wor thy of an Emirati 
˚eld hospital.
 
 
196
 
Thes e are the ˚eld hospitals in the south, in addition to an annexe d hospital of the Palestine Re d 
Crescent in Khan Younis, the Kuwaiti Red Crescent Hospital, which has ICU bed s, inpatient bed s, 
a portable X-ray machine, and about 40 beds. But it is a˜iliated with the Palestine Red Crescent 
Hospital [al-A mal].
 
197
 
T here™s also what is called the Jerusalem Hospital in Rafah, a˜iliated with the R ed Crescent, but it 
lacks the complete facilities to be considered a hospital. It only has inp atient rooms without surgical 
facilities, X-rays, or labs. It™s called a hospital, but it doesn™t reach that level. Thes e are the functioning 
hospitals in Rafah.
 
 
198
 
There is also a specialized hosp ital, which the Israeli occupation deliberately targeted, the Kuwaiti 
Specialt y Hospital or Shifa Palestine, which has surgery rooms and X-rays, but no inp atient beds for 
extended stays, only for day surgeries. It operates as a ‚polyclinic™ or a ˚eld hospital.
 
 
199
 
These are the working ˚e ld hospitals in the southern Gaza Strip, along with the only hospital in the 
central area, the International Medical Corps (IMC) hospital, which is a fully equipped hospital with 
about 124 beds. It has X-rays and operating rooms but lacks intensive care units (IC Us), with only four 
post- op beds. They rely on oxygen cylinders since there™s no oxygen generation station. The hospital 
is exp anding its bed cap acit y daily, but it still lacks proper radiology, a CT scanner, and IC U s ervices. 
Some specialties are al so missin g. It is now exten ding to open a children™s an d internal medicin e ward,  
though it hasn™t yet opened.
 
 
200
 
Moreover, the Palestinian Ministry of Health has set up the al-Zawaida ˚e ld hospital, but we are in 
the process of activating it. There are three to ˚ve active [˚eld] hospitals in the Gaza Strip, not as the 
Israeli o ccupation claim s w ith 11, 10, or 12. They have eve n inclu ded small clinics on their map, labelling 
them as ˚eld hospitals. I say, inside the camps Œ this was a question I read Œ there are medical points 
that work in the morning, but they are inadequate. They lack su˜icient treatment for the people, they 
don™t have lab equipment, and there are no specialties, only a general practitioner, a pharmacist, and 
a nurse. These are the points available in every area, but in some camps, even these services are 
lacking, along with the clinics and even water. There is no water for the people, let alone a clinic or 
a specialis ed one. In s ome areas, a tent is s et up by a doctor and a nurs e to give out a few injections 
and pills, but it™s not a clinic; it™s merely a medical point for a doctor and a nurs e.
 
201
 
Researcher: Have there been any issues a˜ecting the work of clinics and ˚eld hospitals in humanitar ian  
areas?
 
202
 
D octor: Fie ld hospitals are always under bombardment. The Red Cross ˚e ld hospital and the IMC 
h ospital wh en it was in Rafah always had the ir surroun din gs t argeted. Even dron es ˚red at th ese 
hospitals. The Red Cross hospital often had bombings and drone strikes around it, and mass casualt y 
incidents would overwhe lm the hospital™s capa city. Additionally, there™s been bombing near governm ent  
hospitals and even within government hospitals, such as Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital. Bombings in the 
camps als o damage all the tents and medical clinics there. The Israeli occupation shows no respect 
for medical teams, hospitals , or medical centres, even ˚eld hospitals . T here is no sanctity for these 
hospitals, and we need guarantees for the safet y of operations within them, whether government 
hospitals, ˚eld hospitals, or medical points.
 
441
203
 
Res earcher:  Many  patients  from humanitarian  areas s u˜er  from a  lack  of transportation  and  the 
distance to ˚eld hospitals –
 
204
 
Doctor: The overcrowding of people is a cause of disease spread. Tents worsen conditions for chronic 
patients. The lack of transportation and di˜iculty of movement with the overcrowding can cause 
patients to die in ambulances before they reach a m edical point, a ˚e ld hospital, or a governm ent 
hospital. Patients als o struggle to ˚nd medicine. For example, p ainkillers like Acamol, Trophen, C oxib, 
and 
Tram adol 
seem like they are from another world Œ rarely foun d. Even if yo u reach the clinic, 
you™ll ˚nd they™ve run ou t. The re™s a sho rta g e of m edicines, treatme nts, and di˜icul ties in g etting to 
hospitals, all due to the Israe li occup ation crowding people into camps. A mbulances can™t transport 
patients safel y without running over other pe ople, hitting tents, or colliding with passersby. Thi s i s 
the situation. The war needs to stop. The war is behind every calamit y in the Gaza Strip, and it must 
end before it™s too late.

2.1
 
Our analysis of the ˛rst three weeks of the aerial bombing campaign in Gaza (7˚28 October 2023) 
indicates: 
(A)
 
The timing of the Israeli military™s airstrikes on speci˛c infrastructure correlates with the time at 
which a higher density of civilians would be expected to be present.
(a)
 
Strikes on residential buildings happened more at night than during the day. 
(b)
 
Strikes on c ommercial s paces, including bake ries and markets happened more during 
operational hours than outside of operational hours.
(B)
 
Israel™s attacks south of Wadi Gaza increased after it ordered civilians from the north to evacuate to 
the south.
2.2
 
Our analysis of the ˛rst ten months of Israel™s military campaign in Gaza (7 OctoberŒ6 July) 
indicates:
(A)
 
Public infrastructure was destroyed even after it had been previously damaged, and when it was 
unlikely to be occupied.
(B)
 
Areas in proximit y to critical infrastructure were targeted: 
(a)
 
We observed repeated damage to service roads imm ediately surrounding cr itical infrastructure.
(b)
 
We obs erved repeated destruction of buildings in the same vicinit y, leading to accumulation 
of debris on the roads surrounding critical infrastructure.
(C)
 
Repeated disruption of road networks isolated civilians in two ways:
(a)
 
It was more di˜icult for civilians to leave areas in which infrastructure had been destroyed.
(b)
 
It was more di˜icult for aid to reach civilians in th ose areas disconn ected from the road n etwork.
509
C˜
BACKGROUND
23
 
Gaza is one of the most densely populated regions in the world, with approximately 15,000 people 
per square mile.
1
 The high density c reates an urban fabric where residential areas and c ritical and 
public infrastructure Œ such as hospitals, schools, power plants, desalination plants Œ are located in 
close proximit y.
24
 
The longstanding block ade on G aza restricted the import of construction materials, fuel, and other 
essential resources. As a result, critical systems Œ already stres sed by th e high dem ands of the densely  
p acked  population  Œ  were made  further  vulnerable  to  collaps e  during  military  con˘ict.
25
 
Between 7 Octobe r 2023 and 6 July 2024, Gaz a™s already fragile infra s tructure experie nced extensive 
damage and destruction. In the ˚rst month of the military camp aign, the Israeli military dropped over 
25,000 tons of munitions on densely built areas, which caused, beyon d a human toll e stimated for 
that period to be 10,328 deaths, exten sive damage to critical infrastructure, public facilities, and road 
transport n etworks.
2
 
Th e months that followed saw the near total destr uction of Gaza™s infrastructure.
3
 
This report pres ents an analysis of this destruction and its e˜ects on the civilian population.

SCOPE
26
 
This analysis is divided into t wo scales:
27
 
(1) For the period bet ween 7 October to 28 October 2023 we us e a 
dail y
 analysis to show the granular 
relationship between airstrike s, th e de str uction of infrastructure , and ci vilian casualtie s. We use 
veri˚ed s ocial media reports and geolocated visual evidence to identify and analys e incidents. Each 
incident includes location, time of reporting, time of incident (where known), number of people killed 
and injured, and information on families killed.
 
28
 
(2) For the per iod between 7 Octo ber 2023 to 6 July 2024, we u se a 
monthly
 analysis to show the 
wider p attern of infrastructural damage and destruction. This us es datas ets from the United Nations 
Satellite Centre (UNO SAT ). Taken together, the overall analysis demonstrates repeated and cumulative  
de struction acros s both critical an d public infrastructure, which resulted in the isolation of ci vilians f rom  
ess ential s ervices such as shelter, healthcare, and aid, loss of c ivilian life, and loss of cultural heritage. 
2 9
 
The us e of munitions and the p atterns of attacks on civil s ociet y professionals are outside the scope 
of this section. While ackn owledgin g th e impact on in dividual s providin g critical infrastr ucture, th e 
report does not make observations re lated to attac ks on individuals or civil society organisations. 
Instead, the report focuses on the dismantling of the civilian infrastructure system.

METHODOLOGY
1˜
Daily resolution an alysis between 7ˆ28 October
31
 
From 7 October to 28 O ctober 2023, our incident analysis is based on social media reports and 
geolocated visual evidence, providing a detailed daily log of airstrikes. For a given incident, key data 
points are documente d, including location, time of report, time of inc ident (if available), type of building  
hit, number of casualties and injuries, identi˚cation of a˜ected families and o˜icials, munition t ype (if 
k nown), and geolocation . Geolocation accuracy is categorised as exact, approximate, neighbourhood, 
town/cit y, or Gaza level. 
32
 
Our analysis includ es data fro m the Air war s civilian casual ty database.
4
 In ad di tio n to civilian c a su al ties,  
we have expanded our analysis to inc lude attacks on infrastructure and what the Isra eli military c lassi˚es  
as  ‚power  tar ge ts™.
5
 These include high-rise buildings, residential towers, and public institutions such 
a s universities, banks , and government o˜ices . According to the Israeli military sp okesp erson on 11 
October, during the ˚rst ˚ve days of ˚ghting, approximately half of the targets bombed 
Œ
 1,32 9 out of 
a total of 2,687 
Œ 
were classi˚ed as ‚power targets™.
6
 
33
 
We veri˚ed and u sed data from the al-Ha q™s g eo lo catio n database, research published by o pe n-
sourc e rese arch ers, and additional repor ts po sted on Telegram by three key media outlet s: Al Jazeera ,  
Shehab News, and A l A rabiya. 
3 4
 
To ˚ll in gaps and validate vis ual reporting where it is incomplete or unavailable , we use satellite imagery  
from Planet and UNOSAT damage analysis . The integration of satellite data has been instrumental 
in con˚rming and geolocating incidents that A irwars has documented but was unable to geolocate. 
As a result, our databas e currently contains 998 incidents between 7 October and 28 October 2023, 
with 244 incidents geolocated to exact location accuracy, 264 inc idents to approximate location 
ac curacy, 209 incidents to neighbourho od accuracy, and 269 incidents to town/city ac curacy and 
12 incidents to Gaza accuracy.

We use this database of exact location airstrike s and match them to are as of de struction shown in 
the 15 October UNOSAT damage map. By applying a densit y clustering technique, we identify sp atial 
con centrations of destr uction that corre spond to geolocated airstrikes. This allows us to study the 
p atterns of damage of each reported airstrike.

Density-bas ed clustering of damage in relat ion to geolocated air st rikes in Ga za City by 15 October 2023.
36
 
By analysing spatial p atterns from exactly geolocate d airstrikes and their clustered damage in thos e 
areas, we can identify similar characteristics in the surrounding regions. In areas where no airstrikes 
were reported, or where strikes were only approximate ly geolocated but visible damage appears 
in the UNO SAT layer, we apply a density clustering technique to estim ate likely dam age from aerial 
bombing. This allows us to interpolate the locations of unreported or imprecisely located airstrikes , 
estimating their imp act bas ed on the sp atial densit y of visible damage.
514

37
 
We then repeat the process with remaining airstrikes from 1 5 October to 28 October, using the 7 
November UNOSAT layer, to interpolate the sp atial distribution of airstrikes. We obtain a ˚nal layer of 
airstrikes that includes the geolocated and the interpolated ones.

Monthly resolution analysis of patterns of destruction from 7 October 2023 to 6 July 2024
39
 
Our analysis of infra structural damage from 7 October 2023 to 6 July 2024 relies primarily on UNOSAT  
satellite analysis to identify and classify damage to buildings and facilities. The key dates covered by 
the UNOS AT dataset include 15 October 2023, 7 November 2023, 26 November 2023, 7 January 
2024, 29 Feb r uary 2024 , 1 April 2024 , 3 M ay 2024 , and 6 July 2024. Our methodology start s with 
UNOSAT categorisation, which we subs equently cross-reference against our own veri˚cation methods,  
to arrive at a more textured understanding of infrastructural destruction.
40
 
Using UNOSAT analysis, we establish three possible states for infrastructure: 
(a)
 
Destroyed
(b)
 
Damaged
(c)
 
Unknown
41
 
We divide G aza into an 80-metre hexagonal grid to standardis e the analysis of sp atial features.
7
 Using  
building outlines from the Micros oft OpenStreetMap (OS M) datas et, we can systematically count the 
number of structures within each hexagon. 
Using the UNOSAT damage layer, we match geolocated 
damage point s f rom UNOSAT with the buildin g outline s f rom the Microsoft OSM dataset. This method 
enables us to identify the number of buildings damaged in each hexagon over speci˚c periods. This 
method o˜ers insights into which regions are more heavily imp acted.

To speci˚cally identify dama g ed o r des troyed building s from critical and p ublic infras tructure, we 
match geolocated damage points from UNOSAT with the building outlines from the Micros oft OS M 
datas et. UNOSAT provides point data for each damaged structure, which we align with our existing 
building infrastructure location data to ensure accuracy.
43
 
Once the locations of damaged and destroyed infrastructure are identi˚ed using UNOSAT data, we 
conduct a sec ondary ver i˚cation process. This involves cross-referencing the locations of infrastructure  
with monthl y Planet satellite imagery to vi s ually con˚rm whether the buildings can b e cle arl y identi˚ed  
as destroyed. See 
Figure  6.4
. 
This process enables us to c reate an original, independent datas et of 
damaged and destroyed infrastructure, ensuring 
that our a ssessments are supported by m ultiple 
s ources of evidence and improving the con˚dence in the data.

To study the pat tern of destruction, we cross-reference our ˚ndings with open-source reports to 
track when the damage or destruction occurred and to distinguish the speci˚c caus es of destruction 
Œ  whether  from  initial  airstrikes,  ground operations,  or demolitions.

Local accessibilit y analysis
45
 
We use the inc ident database and the UNOSAT damage layer to asse ss the impact of craters and 
debris on road accessibility near critical infrastructure. Critic al sites such a s hospitals or shelters were 
identi˚ed, and road networks adjacent to these locations were evaluated for damage that impeded 
vehicle access. Using satellite imagery, we identi˚ed repeated incidents where streets were cut o˜, 
blocking critical infrastructure such as ambulances and other vehicles. 
46
 
Th e analysis map s areas wh ere road damage delayed or prevented access. GIS tool s are used to create  
vi s uali sation s of inaccessible areas, showing the proximity of road damage to critical infrastructure. 
Some cas e studies further illustrate the recurring road damage and its imp act on emergency s ervices 
and daily access to critical infrastructure.
3.2
 
Road network analysis
47
 
For the road net work anal ysis, we us ed driving routes from OpenStreetMap for Gaza and identi˚ed 
road s egments within 25 metres of damaged areas, as recorded in various UNOSAT damage layers. 
The 25 -metre bu˜er i s base d on the lethal radius of the explosive weapon s commonl y use d by the 
Israeli  military  in  Gaza.
8
 This distance is the most cons ervative estimate, supported by previous peer-
reviewed studies on infrastructure damage in Gaza.
9
 We focus speci˚cally on driving routes, as these 
are the most critical for ambulances and for evacuations during"
Introduction,,displacement
Introduction,,".
48
 
We estimated the percenta ge of damaged road s in north and south Gaza separate ly based on UNOSAT  
damage data from 1 5 October, 7 November, and 7 January (the latter only for the south), and visualised 
the damaged road networks . These dates were selected because damage after 7 November in the 
north, and after 7 January in the south, becomes so extensive that it signi˚ cantly alters the street 
net work. Finally, we vi sualis e the damage d road networks based on thi s temporal data to highlight 
the extent of destruction across the regions. 
4 9
 
We use damage to th e street network to estimate the acc e ssibility of ho spit als and the evac uation 
c or rid or in no rth Gaza and of hos pi tals and the al-Mawasi ‚humani tarian zo ne™ in south Gaza at the 
di˜erent levels of damage.
50
 
The ˚rst step focuses on de˚ning which road s egments are adjacent to critical infrastructure by 
creating a 25-metre bu˜er zone around thes e fac ilities. Road s egments within this bu˜er are considered  
‚adjacent™ to the hospitals or evacuation corridor, and from these points, the shortest path distance 
is calculated along the road net work. This initial step establishes the bas eline accessibilit y, showing 
how  far  one  can  travel  through  the  remaining undamaged  roads.

In the second step, the analysis shifts to a hexagonal grid system. Each hexagon in this grid is assigned  
the shortest p ath distance to the nearest hospital, corridor, or safe zone. Aggregating the data at the 
hexagonal level helps to simplify the sp atial analysis and provides a consistent metric for comp aring 
accessibility ac ross di˜erent areas of Gaza. This grid-bas ed approach o˜ers an organis ed way to 
visualis e how far each hexagon is from key facilities, allowing for comp aris on of distances before and 
after road damage.
52
 
The third step involves calculating how road damage a˜ects these shortest path distances over 
time, at three key dates: 15 October, 7 November, and 7 January. By comp aring thes e distances with 
the undamaged road net work, the anal ysis identi˚es areas where accessibilit y wors ens. If the roads 
connecting a hexagon to hospitals, corridors, or the safe zone are entire l y damaged, the hexagon is 
considere d ‚disconne cte d™ from critical infrastructure. This distinction b etwe en distance increase s 
and total disc onnectio n is important for under standing the varying d egrees of a c cessibility loss, 
and  is olation.
53
 
Finally, the results are visualis ed through a heat map, where colour variations repres ent the increas e 
in travel dist an ce due to road damage . A quantile class i˚cation sch eme is used, meanin g th e map 
colours represent equal numbers of hexagons, even if the distance inc reases themselves di˜er wide ly.  
This  technique  highlights  areas  with  signi˚cant  access  issues  while  maintaining  balance  across  the  
map™s colour scale. Hexagon s that have b ecome fully disconnecte d f rom the road network are marked  
in grey, making them stand out as areas where road damage has completely is olated the population 
from key infrastructure.

TIMELINE 
5 4
 
First three weeks (b ombing campaign): 7˛28 Octob er 2023
55
 
The ˚rst three weeks of the bombing camp aign saw intens e infrastructural damage and destruction 
across Gaza, with the majorit y caus ed to residential infrastructure. Damage was concentrated mainly 
in Gaza City in th e n or th. Th e distrib ution of airstrikes al so varied through out th e day: residential 
buildings were more likely to be struck at night, whereas commercial buildings were more likely to be 
struck during operational hours. After the 13 Octob er evacuation order was i ss ue d, ci vilian s starte d 
moving from the north to s outh. During this time, the number of airstrikes in the south increas ed from 
85 interpolated airstrikes bet ween 7 October 2024 and 10 October 2024, to 151 interpolated airstrikes 
bet ween 11 October 2024 and 15 October 2024. During this time, the Rafah crossing was damaged 
by repeated airstrikes (9, 10, 16 October).
56
 
Ground invasion of north of Gaza: f rom 27 Octob er 2023
5 7
 
The gro und invasion proceeded in two directions s imultaneously. First, the Israeli military entered from  
the north, advancing south towards Gaza Cit y. Second, entering from the east moving west roughly 
along Wadi Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea (the area that would later become the Netzarim corridor, 
s ee Chapter 2: Spatial C ontrol) redirecting north to Gaza Cit y. Infrastructural damage and destruction 
dur ing this tim e co ntinu ed, sometim es p roximate to the ground invasion (see facto r of distance increase  
s ection), and s ometimes with no direct correlation to the ground invasion (s ee disruption of road 
access). As civilians began to relocate through the Salah al-Din evacuation corridor following the 13 
October evacuation order, infrastructural damage and destruction leading to accumulation of debris 
on the path can be observed . This hindered e˜ective u se of the corr idor itself, but also rendered it 
increasingly di˜icult for civilians to access (see factor of distance increase). 
58
 
Ground invasion of south of Gaza: f rom 4 Decemb er 2023
59
 
Following the ground invasion in the south, at tacks on cultural and religious sites , such as the Palace of  
Justice, al-Houda Mos que, and al- Saqqa Mos que, continued. Additionally, repeat damage to al-Israa 
Univers ity, University of Palestine, and al-Uma Univers ity in January 2024, March 2024, and April 2024  
respectively, suggests that universit y buildings were targeted. Destruction of this kind was repeated 
after buildings were rendered unusable, and to the point of total collaps e.

Repeated destruction of key infrastructure continued after the third order for Provisional Measures 
dated 24 May 2024.  
67
 
During the t wo -month period from 5 May to 6 July 2024, a total of 9,524 structures were destroyed. 
This is more than d oubl e the numbe r of s truc tures d es troyed in the p reviou s two m o nths (29 February

7 January to 2 9 February, when 8,899 structures were destroyed.
68
 
Between 5 May and 6 Jul y, a total of 10,308 structure s were damage d, which i s thre e times higher than  
the number of damaged structures in the previous period from 29 February to 5 May, which was 3,213.

The timing of the Israeli military™s airstrikes on infrastructure correlates with the time at which a 
higher density of civilians would be expected to be present.
7 0
 
We anal yse d the times at which residential and commercial servic es were struck in the ˚rst thre e 
weeks of Israel™s bombing camp aign, and found that:
(A)
 
Strikes on residential buildings happened more at night than during the day 
Figure 6.11

Israel™s attacks south of Wadi Gaza increased after it ordered civilians from the north to evacuate to 
the south.
71
 
Our analysis of the sp atial distribution of Israeli airstrikes over time suggests a p attern by which Israel 
increasingly attacked areas 
after it instructed
 civilians to evacuate to them
. After the 13 October 
evacuation order instructing civilians to move from the north to the south of Wadi Gaza, the average of 
airstrikes in the south increased.
11
 This resulted in an overall increas e in civilian deaths in comp aris on 
to the average number of civilians killed per day before 13 October. A mong thos e killed in the s outh 
after the 13 October evacuation order included families who had followed the evacuation orders and 
evacuated to the southern areas [

Analysis of the ˚rst ten months of Israel™s military campaign in Gaza (7 OctoberŒ6 July)
2.1
 
Public infrastructure was destroyed even after it had been previously damaged, and when it was 
unlikely to be occupied.
72
 
The following section details the destruction of s ites of public infrastructure after those s ites had been  
previo usly dam aged. This pattern of recurrent attack to speci ˚c buildin gs suggests that th ey were 
singled out by military strikes , and that consequently destruction of such infrastructure was more 
likely to be deliberate than random. 
73
 
We  us ed  geolocation  techniques  and  drew  from  open-s ource  intelligence  to  identify  this  condition. 
Eac h key site was observed through initial and subsequent damage, in order to ascertain the c hronology  
of attacks and obs erve how thes e attacks might constitute a p attern. 
74
 
In ad ditio n to tracking indiv idual si tes, we also o bse rved that buil dings si tuated near mili tar y rou tes 
were often at greater risk of be in g destroyed. 
This correlation between proximity to milit ary movement 
and increase d infrastructural vulnerability suggests that infrastructure near these routes was more 
likely to be targeted.
75
 
Through this analysis, we show how the"
Introduction,,destruction of civilian infrastructure
Introduction,,"appears to be p art of a 
broader  military  strate gy,  rather  than  a  s eries  of  is olated  incidents.
76
 
The cas e studies below are organis ed as follows:
(a)
 
Repeat damage to the Rafah crossing (9 ˝17 October 2023; 5 MayŒ19 June 2024)
(b)
 
Repeat damage to buildings in A l Zahra area: Palace of Justice, al-Israa Universit y, Universit y 
of Palestine, and al-Uma Universit y (20 NovemberŒ24 June)
(c)
 
Repeat damage to the Universit y C ollege of A pplied Sciences (24 MayŒ12 August 2024)

Rafah crossing (9 OctoberŒ17 October 2023; 5 MayŒ19 June 2024)
77
 
This analysis shows the repeated disruption of the Rafah crossing by the Israeli military (and limiting 
the entrance of aid). Rafah crossing was the sole entry point for humanitarian aid into Gaza after 7 
October and became a critical lifeline as all other crossings were controlled by Israel and clos ed (s ee 
Chapter 7: Targeting of A id).
78
 
Str ikes on Rafah crossing began as early as 9 October, followed by two m ore on 10 October.

The Palace of Justice, al-Israa Universit y, al-Uma universit y, and the Universit y of Palestine are in the 
clearing zone of the Netzarim corridor, which was con structed through the destruction of critical and 
public infra structure as well a s agricultural lands and systems (see Chapter 2:"

the Universit y C ollege of A pplied Sciences lies adjacent to a newly constructed military corridor, as

Areas in proximit y to critical infrastructure were targeted: 
(A)
 
Repeated disruption of service roads immediately surrounding critical infrastructure
(B)
 
Repeated destruction of buildings, leading to the accumulation of debris on the roads surrounding 
critical infrastructure 
106
 
During October and early November, critical infrastructure became increasingly isolated. A irstrikes 
impacte d access roads around critical infrastructure, either through dire ct attack s or through the 
accumulation of debris from nearby damaged or destroyed buildings . This is particularly evident in 
area s around hospitals where satellite imagery shows roads rendered impassable. In such conditions, 
ambulances and emergency vehicles are unable to reach these facilities. In addition, o ur ˚ndings show  
the repeated destruction of access roads around shelters, which restricts the movement of civilians 
to s afe areas, and the d es tru ctio n of si tes p roximate to the Salah al-Din Road evacuatio n c o r rid o r, 
restricting the movement of civilians following evacuation orders.
107

Repeated disruption of road networks isolated civilians in two ways:
(A)
 
It was more di˜icult for civilians to leave areas in which infrastructure had been destroyed 
(B)
 
It was more di˜icult for aid to reach civilians in those areas
108
 
The destruc tio n of roads not only limi ts ac cess to cri tical infra s tructure like hos pi tals, s helte rs, and 
evacuation routes but als o blocks the delivery of essential supplies, including humanitarian aid, to 
densely populate d urban areas where they are often most urgently ne eded. C onse quently, this collapse 
of  transport  infrastructure  further  exacerbates  the  conditions  produce d through  military  destruction  
and damage, leaving civilians with little or no access to res ources needed to sustain conditions of life.

We estimated the percenta ge of damaged road s in north and south Gaza separate ly based on UNOSAT  
damage data from 15 Oc to be r, 7 November, and 7 January (the latter only fo r south). These dates were 
s elected becaus e damage after 7 November in the north, and after 7 January in the s outh, becomes 
s o extensive that it signi˚cantly alters the street net work.
1 10
 
At th e same time , the de struction of roads complicated evac uation e˜or ts. Despite repe ated instructions  
for ci vilians to evacuate f rom the nor th to the south, the se evacuation s were hindere d by damaged 
roads.
46
 From December onwards, ci vilians in the south were also told to evac uate from the e ast to 
the west, but unsafe and unstable roads made it more di˜icult for many to follow these orders.
47
 In  
some instances, civilians were forced to ˘ ee on foot, though m any co uld not walk.
48
 Overall, pedestrian  
movement was more precarious. 
111
 
This analysis shows that while the eventual destruction of infrastructure pressured people to leave 
certain areas, the very means of ensuring their safe evacuation were als o disrupted, leaving civilians 
stranded in  zones  most  vulnerable  to  ongoing  military  operations  and  humanitarian  collaps e.

Factor of di stance increase to the nearest hospit al in northern Gaza
1 13
 
As early as 15 October, data shows that the shortest distance to the nearest hospital for many civilians 
increased up to 8.55 km (see 
Figure 6.6 9
). Additionally, three areas were completely disconn ected due  
to bombing , cutting them o˜ from a ccess to cr itical infrastructure, inc luding eva cuation corridors (see 
Figure  6.69
). Our analysis shows that thes e areas later became entry points for the ground invasion 
on 27 October. This left already is olated civilians vulnerable to the  military camp aign.

By 7 November, the level of disconnection intensi˚ed, is olating entire areas such as B eit Hanoun, B eit 
Lahia, and p arts of Gaza Cit y, including al-Zaytoun (s ee

). Civilians in thes e regions were 
cut o˜ from ess ential res ources, evacuation routes, and aid deliveries.

Spatial Control,,".

This report shows a p attern of physical destruction in Gaza, disproportionately a˜ecting civilians and 
the conditions required to sustain life. 
The repeat attacks on key sites such as universities, mos ques, 
and governm ent o˜ices suggest that these were not incidental strikes, but a coordinated e˜ort to 
dismantle public infrastructure.
1 20
 
The construction of the Israeli military™s Netzarim corridor further increased the vulnerability of civilian 
infrastructure. Buildings such as the Palace of Justice and al-Israa Universit y, situated near or within 
military zones, were more frequently attacked, suggesting a correlation bet ween military operations 
and  the  repeated  destruction  of  public  facilities.
1 21
 
The d es tru ction of road s has hinde red a c cess to cr itic al infrastruc ture su ch as hos pi tals o r eva cuatio n 
corridors, while als o  obstructing  the  delivery of  humanitarian  aid. T
his fragmentation  of  the  tran sportation  
network has isolated densely populated areas, leaving civilians c ut o˜ from e ssential servic e s and 
increasing the challenges for delivering humanitarian aid. Additionally, the breakdown of thes e networks  
has forced many people to relocate.
1 22
 
This has had a t wofold e˜ect: while infrastructural destruction was one means by which civilians were 
forced to relocate from one p art of Gaza to another 
Œ
 for example, from the north, through Wadi Gaza, 
to the south
 Œ
 destruction of roads has made this more di˜icult, requiring many to make this journey 
by foot, which left vulnerable groups such as the elderly and the wounded unable to evacuate safely.

Aid
: We u se the term ‚aid™ to refer to mater ial and logistical assistance to Palestinians throughout Gaza,  
in accordance with the ICJ™s provisional measures order for Israe l to en sure ‚unhindered provision at 
scale™ of ‚urgently n eeded basic servic e s an d humanitarian assistance , including food, water, electricity,  
fuel, shelter, clothing, hygiene and sanitation requirements, as well as medical supplies ...™.
1
3
 
Escalated attacks:
 We use the term ‚escalated attacks™ to refer to a signi ˚cant increase in the rate 
of attacks obse rved fo r a give n aid categ or y. This is d eter mined by cross-referencing the tim e and 
location of all re corded incidents with one another, along with contextual research ab out a given period.
4
 
Vigilante:
 We us e the term ‚vigilante™ in this chapter to refer to Israeli civilians who have acted, without 
o˜icial state instruction, to attack or disrupt aid routes and aid convoys destined for Gaza.

Decon˙icted
: A site whose operation s and coordinates have b e en coordinate d with the Israeli 
authorities to protect and exempt it from military targeting.
6
 
Netzarim corridor
: A militaris ed border constructed by Israel just north of the Wadi Gaza River, which 
divides Gaza into a north and a s outh, and which played a signi˚cant role in limiting aid crossing into 
nor thern G aza. A dir t path in the shape of the b order appeared by 15 Novemb er 2023, and che ckpoints  
were constructed on the border to intercept aid trucks by 12 January 2024.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
7
 
Our analysis of incidents in which aid was attacked indicates that the Israeli military repeatedly targeted  
aid across Gaza since the Israeli military campaign began in October 2023. The repeated nature of 
such attac ks suggests that they were not random. 
1˜
Quantitative ˜n dings
1.1
 
We documented 322 incidents of aid-targeting between 7 October 2023 and 16 September 2024. 
Of which:
(a)
 
17 attacks were on bakeries
(b)
 
73 attacks were on shelters for displaced Palestinians, such as UNRWA-run schools, where 
food aid was received and distributed
(c)
 
60 attacks were on aid pers onnel
(d )
 
50 attacks were on civilians seeking aid Œ 37 of these occur red just north of the Netzarim 
corridor between January and March 2024. (More civilians were killed in attac ks which we 
have classi˜ed as attacks on other targets.)
(e)
 
78 attacks were on aid infrastructure, such as warehous es and water treatment facilities
(f)
 
22 attacks were on convoys of trucks transp orting aid through Gaza, which were coordinated 
by  humanitarian  aid  organisations  
(g)
 
6 attacks were on aid convoys en route to Gaza through Israel or the occupied West Bank, 
carried  out  by  Israeli  vigilantes  during  May  2024
(h)
 
16 attacks were on markets where aid was being obtained by civilians
(i)
 
At least 17 of the attacks on aid pers onnel, convoys, and infrastructure targeted sites involved 
in operations that had been o˚icially coordinated with Israe l and recognis ed as ‚decon˛icted 
sites™, understood to be exempt from Israeli military targeting, or ‚safe™.
1.2
 
We documented the following attacks on aid sites and systems operated by UNRWA:
(a)
 
Among the attacks on aid p ersonnel, convoys , and infra structure, at lea st 39 were on UNRWA  
personnel, facilities, or vehicles. 
(b)
 
In total, 195 UNRWA personnel were killed, including 177 sta˚ members and 18 other aid workers.
(c)
 
A nother 40 UNRWA sta˚ members have been detained by the Israeli military.
722
2˜
Pat tern ˚n dings
2.1
 
Our analysis indicates that the Israeli military targeted sites and systems of aid distribution when 
and where they became the main mode of aid facilitation. We observed that this targeting followed 
a pattern of overlapping phases, during which attacks on the speci˛ed aid categories intensi˛ed:
(a)
 
Octob erŒNovemb er 2023: Bakeries 
in the north of Gaza were targeted when they played a 
critical  role  in  aid distribution,  
during October and early Novemb er 2023.
 By mid-November, 
there were no o˜icial bakeries still in operation in Gaza Cit y. 
(b)
 
Octob er 2023˛Januar y 2024: She lters
 were targeted when they assume d a central role in 
housing people displaced by Israeli attacks, and facilitating the receipt and preparation of 
food aid, 
f rom 13 Octob er to Decemb er 2023.
(c)
 
December 2023˛February 2024: Pales tinian police o˝icers
, who we cate gorise as 
ai d 
personnel
, were targeted when they played a critical role in escorting aid convoys.
(d )
 
Januar yŒMarch 2024: Civilian s
 were targeted when gathering to receive aid from aid trucks 
that p ass ed through the Netzarim corridor checkpoints into northern Gaza 
f rom Januar y to 
March 2024.
(e)
 
March 2024: Aid a dminis trators
 from Palestinian organisations and groups that took up 
respons ibility for facilitating aid delivery and distribution, who we categorise as 
aid pe r so nn el
, 
we re targ eted whe n they began to play a p ro mine nt ro l e 
in Ma rch 2024
. Atta cks o n these 
personnel and organi sation s were ex ten sive and deadly enough to eliminate their key 
administrators or otherwise force them to cease operating.
(f)
 
October 2023, De cember 2023, and May 2024: Aid distribution and stor age sites
, in clud ing  
warehouse s and market s, were targeted when they were acti vely operating to supply ci vilians 
with food, with severe at tacks on Rafah crossing, Karem Abu S alem/Kerem Shalom crossing, 
and markets during periods of increased aid- entering.
(g)
 
May 2024: Israeli vigilantes
 attacked aid convoys p assing through Israel and the occupied 
West Bank under the watch and sometimes with direct support of Israeli military pers onnel. 
2.2
 
The periods after which Israel increased the ˝ow of humanitarian aid into Gaza (late December 
2023; late March and early April 2024; early May 2024) coincide in time and space with an 
increase of Israel™s targeting of the means of distributing that aid, including the logistics, personnel, 
and infrastructure necessary.
2.3
 
The"
Targeting of Aid,,targeting of aid
Targeting of Aid,,"occurred in tandem with the Israeli military™s evacuation orders and coincides 
with its attempts to force Palestinian civilians to displace from the nor th of Gaza. The construction 
of the new internal border in the Netzarim corridor and the checkpoints within it supporting a 
one-way (north to south) movement of civilians coincided with the restriction of aid as a means of"

BACKGROUND
8
 
Since 2007, when Hamas took control of Gaza, Israel has placed restrictions on all provisions coming 
into Gaz a throu gh crossings c o ntro ll ed by the Is raeli militar y, exe rcising almos t c o mp l ete c o ntro l 
over con ditions of li fe in Gaza.
2
 Th e quantity of food was reduc ed to the minimum calories deemed 
necessary for survival, with the total amount calculated according to a population count factoring in 
age and gender.
3
9
 
Electricit y supply was calibrated to bring life in Gaza to a near standstill.
4
 Medical  aid  was  restricted  
to a level that would keep Gaza just over the threshold of a ‚humanitarian disaster ™ Œ although multiple 
UN agencies judge that this level was cross ed s ome time ago.
5
 
10
 
On 7 October 2023, approximately half of the population of Gaza was ‚food ins ecure™, and more than 
80 %  relied  on  humanitarian  aid.
6
 Under the terms of a strict blockade, over 80 % of goods, and t wo -
thirds of foodstu ˜ s entered Gaza thro ugh Israeli checkpoints. According to the UN, the tot al of in˘ owin g  
aid amounted to 500 truckloads per working day, roughly 10,000 truckloads a month.
1 1
 
On 9 Octobe r 2023, Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant announced that Isra el was ‚imposing a complete  
siege on Gaza. No electricit y, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is clos ed. We are ˚ghting human 
animals, and we are acting accordingly.™ 
7
1 2
 
From 9 to 21 October 2023, Israel e˜ectively blocked all aid from entering Gaza by disabling all of the 
crossings leading into Gaza, which provided the only means for aid to enter.
 
8
 When Israel reopened 
the Rafah border crossing on 21 October,
9
 it restricted the number of trucks allowed to enter Gaza
10
 
to an average of 52 (until th e cease˚re on 24 November).

agricultural sector (see Chapter 4: Destr uction of Agriculture an d Water Resources) in the early st ages  
of the assault, this throttling of aid occurred at a time when food provision was urgently needed. Israel 
also reduced the number of open c rossings into the south of Gaza, while c losing all c rossings that 
could have delivered aid directly to the north. 
13
 
While the 29 Feb ruary ‚Flour Massacre™ and the 1 April att ack on the World Central Kitchen convoy 
are the most widely reported attacks on aid, we have documented a total of 322 attacks by the Israeli 
military on aid sites and systems. 
14
 
We have previously documented the attacks on aid in an online platform at www.gaza-aid-at tacks.

SCOPE
15
 
In this chapter, we examine Israel™s attacks on and impediments to various s ites and systems of aid 
distribution in Gaza from October 2023 to September 2024. Our analysis of thes e attacks address es 
the  following:
(a)
 
The frequency of Israeli attacks on aid sites and systems in sp ace and time.
(b)
 
How thes e attacks correlate to signi˚cant changes in the availabilit y and coordination of aid, 
such as the opening of border crossings and the emergence of new aid systems or groups.
(c)
 
The relation bet ween attacks on aid sites and systems and the"

TIMELINE
19
 
Our analysis identi˚es the following phas es in Israel™s attacks on aid sites and systems in Gaza: 
1˜
First three Weeks of bombing: 7ˆ27 October 2023
20
 
Following 7 October, long queues of Palestinians were seen outside bakeries. Israeli bombing destroyed  
bakeries, primarily in the north of Gaza (e.g., Gaza Cit y), and on three documented occasions directly 
after images of queues circulated online (s ee Section H1: Attacks on bakeries).
21
 
Th e Rafah cro s sing was att acked in at least three strike s between 9 October an d 1 6 October, 
disrupting 
the entry of aid from Egypt
 (s ee Section  H 6:  Attacks on  aid  infrastructure
 
and Chapter 6: Destruction 
of Civilian Infrastructure).
2˜
Groun d Invasion of nor th of Gaza: from 27 October 2023
22
 
The Israeli military continued to attack bakeries. By late October, an estimated 600,000 Palestinians 
were displac ed to sh elters, which by then had begun to function as place s for receiving and distributing  
aid.
13
 Israeli military bombing attacked shelters primarily during this period of critical reliance on them 
(s ee Section H2: Attacks on shelters).
3˜
Cease˚re: 24ˆ30 November 2023
23
 
By the start of the temporary ceas e˚re, all bakeries in northern Gaza went out of operation, multiple 
water facilities had been damaged by Israeli ˚re, including the only wate r des alinatio n plant (see 
S ection H6: Attacks on aid infrastructure). 
Telecommunications blacko uts also frustrated the delivery  
of aid; the fourth of which between 16 and 18 
November
 
‚brought the already challenging delivery of 
humanitarian assistance to an almost complete halt,™ according to OCHA.
14
24
 
Attacks on shelters continued after the cease˚re.
 
4˜
Groun d invasion of south Gaza: from 4 December 2023
25
 
On 17 December, following the start of the ground inva sion in the south of Gaza, the Israeli military 
submitted to international pressure and opened the Karem Abu Salem/Kerem S halom crossing Œ a 
transit point for trucks located near Rafah. In the following weeks, the Israeli military attacked various 
aid pe rso nnel invo lved in facilitating the e ntr y a nd dis tribu tio n of aid into Gaz a, incl u ding killing the  
director of the K arem A bu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing (se e Section H3: Attacks on aid pers onnel 
Œ police escorting aid convoys and Section H 6 Attacks on aid infrastructure).

Throughout January and February 2024, the Israeli military attacked Palestinian police o˜icers escorting  
aid convoys, compelling humanitarian organisations to halt operations (s ee Section H3).
27
 
By the date of the order, the Israeli military had ˚nished constructing a militaris ed internal border to 
divide Gaza just north of Wadi Gaza, called the Netzarim corridor. The border had t wo checkpoints at 
its inters ection with the two main northŒs outh arteries Œ the coastal al-Rashid Road and Salah al-Din 
Road, which run s through the centre of the Strip. The che ckpoints re gulate d the ˘ow of aid trucks 
on routes that began at the K arem A bu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing, p ass ed through the s outh of 
Gaza travelling to northern Gaza. 
28
 
Betwe en January and March, we documented 37 di˜erent incidents, in which the Israeli military 
opened ˚re on civilians seekin g aid, each time shortly after aid trucks pas sed thro ugh a Netzarim 
corridor checkpoint.
2 9
 
Throughout March, the Israeli military attacked Palestinian c i vil society organi sation s in northern G aza ,  
which issued statements that they were operating to facilitate aid (s ee Section H5: Attacks on aid 
pers onnel  Œ  aid  administrators).  
30
 
In March, the Israeli military banned UNRWA from operating in the north.
15
6˜
ICJ Order for Additional Provisional Measures: 28 March 2024
31
 
Four days after the order, on 1 April, the Israeli military launched a fatal attack on a World Central 
Kitchen convoy. After international pressure in the wake of the attack compelled Israel to allow more 
aid in on 5 A pril, and 9 April subs equently saw the highest volume of aid enter since 7 October 2023, 
the Israeli military attacked four markets the following week (s ee Section H7: Attacks on markets).
7˜
Groun d invasion of Rafah: from 6 May 2024
32
 
On 6 May, the Israeli military invaded Rafah, destroying aid warehous es there and s eizing the Rafah 
border c rossing with Egypt. Subsequently, the number of aid truc ks entering Gaza fe ll to an all-time low  
since the total blockade in O ctober 2023. The trucks that entered mostly comprised trucks belonging 
to the private s ector. In May, following months of protests and blockades, Israeli vigilantes attacked 
aid trucks and drivers travelling to Gaza through the occupied West Bank and Israel in the pres ence 
of Israe li s oldiers (s ee Section H8: Vigilante Attacks on A id).

METHODOLOGY
35
 
Our res earch involves a t wo -p art analysis:
(a)
 
Collection and veri˚cation of visual evidence and reports, and analysis of incidents where 
aid  was  targeted.  
(b)
 
Identi˚cation of changes to aid sites and systems over time, using open-s ource information 
and witne ss testimonie s (see Chapter 1:"
Introduction,,"for our criteria regarding cre dibility 
of  s our ces).
36
 
For  
(a)
,
 we began collecting information about attacks on civilians s eeking aid and collating them in 
the GC D (see Chapter 1:"
Introduction,,"), spe c ifying the availabilit y of vi sual evidence, me dia sources, 
approximate location (neighbourhood or region), and approximate time. We subsequently investigated  
each incident to identify its precis e geographic coordinates and time where possible. As a result, most  
incidents have a con˚rmed approximate location, while s ome are geolocated precis ely.
37
 
Within our corpus of attacks, we include circumstances where the known presence of Israeli military 
personnel and infrastructure creates choke points for aid logistics where attacks on aid repeatedly and  
frequentl y occur. At thes e location s which are prone to repeate d attacks, attacks from other arme d 
Palestinian groups are possible, namely as di˜erent armed groups attempt to wrest control over aid 
systems. When the speci˚c assailant of an attack is disputed, but when it still occurs at a location of 
repeated attacks by the Israeli military, we include it in our datas et.
38
 
We us e mapping and ge olocation te chniques (se e Methodology in Chapter 1:"
Introduction,,") to accuratel y  
locate incidents captured in visual evidence. This data is cons idered highly reliable as it allows for 
pre c ise identi˚cation and mapping of a˜e cte d areas, which i s critical for analysing pattern s in the 
attacks. We verify incidents using the incident veri˚cation criteria outlined in Chapter 1:"
Introduction,,". 
In this report, we do not identify the speci˚c t ypes of munitions us ed for each attack in question.
39
 
As outlined in Chapter 1:"
Introduction,,", we format data from the GCD relevant to our analysis and plot 
it on a timeline and map through our web-bas ed visualisation plat form. 
40
 
Concurrently, for 
(b)
, we documented political decisions, announcements , and events pertaining to the 
administration  of  aid.  This included  statements  from  Israeli  o˜icials,  humanitarian  aid  organisations,  
and Palestinian organisations, both formal and informal. We als o received testimonies of aid workers 
in Gaza gathered by credible third-p arty s ources.
41
 
We comp ared the data from areas 
(a)
 and  
(b)
 to  identify  relationships  bet we en  attacks  on aid  and  the  
understood level of reliance on the various t ypes of aid sites and systems.
42
 
W ith th e att acks collated into one database , we analysed spatial an d temporal patterns alon gside 
media and vis ual evidence, to identify any relationships bet ween events. This led us to conceptualis e 
attacks on aid according to discrete temporal phas es of attack where di˜erent types of aid sites and 
systems were targeted in turn or where suc h attac ks predominantly escalated (see the following 
subs ection). This identi˚cation of discrete temporal phas es, however, does not mean that the attacks 
in question only occur within a speci ˚c temporal phase; they occur elsewhere, b ut we have highlighted  
temporal periods where attacks of a certain nature are signi˚cant Œ namely because of other contextual 
information and factors that identify thes e periods as signi˚cant beyond the data its elf. A ls o, there are 
732
s ome t ypes of attack on aid that do not ˚t neatly into temporal phas es becaus e they have occurred 
consistently since 7 October 2023. For example, attacks on UNRWA have occurred consistently (s ee 
Section H10: Attacks on UNWRA and decon˘icted sites).

OctoberŒNovember 2023: At tacks on bakeries
47
 
Bakeries in the north of Gaza were attacked when they played a critical role in aid di stribution, f rom 
the beginning of hostilities until November, at whic h point none were operational in the north of Gaza .

734
48
 
In October and early November, videos showed long queues of Palestinians waiting outside bakeries 
in Gaza. As a result of restrictions on basic goods, including water, electricit y, and fuel, many civilians 
in Gaza became reliant on bakerie s as a critical sourc e of food, being unab le to prepare food at home.
16
 
4 9
 
We documented attacks on 14 bakeries in Gaza bet ween October and early November. We als o 
doc umented two attacks on bakeries in December, in De ir al-Balah, as I srael™s ground operation 
moved southwards . On 14 November, the last functioning ˜our mill in Gaza was attacked and 
rendered inoperable.
17
50
 
Bakeries were eith er directly hit, or otherwise destroyed as a result of bombardment of the surro undin gs.  
On other occasions, their solar pane ls or generators were hit. Four bakeries were targeted after images  
of Palestinians queuing outside them were posted online. A video taken on 17 October 2023 shows 
a queue at the Nus eirat bakery the evening before the bakery was attacked. [31018˚ 625 73]
18
 
A video 
of the al-Sofara bake ry was pos ted by Al Jazeera on the m orning of 21 Oc tober 2023, whil e v isual 
evidence shows the bakery was des troyed the following night. [3102 1˚41258]
19
 Images of a queue 
o uts ide the al-Maghazi al-Jadeed bakery were posted on the mornin g of 24 October 2023 and the 
bakery was destroyed shortly after. [31024˚20340] A video of the al- Sharq bakery circulated on s ocial 
media on 2 9 October 2023, and the bakery was attacked on 4 November. [31104˚38923]
20
51
 
The al-Maghazi al-Jadeed bakery had reportedly received ˜our from UNRWA a few hours before 
being bombed.
21
 By the end of October, UNRWA declared that 10 out of the 50 bakeries to which it 
had supplied ˜our had been bombed.
22
52
 
We do cumented: eight c ases, inc lu ding al-Sharq bakery, in w hich the nearby area was bombed, 
damaging the building and injuring civilians; seven cases, including al-Nuseirat bakery, in which the 
target was the building in which the bakery was located Œ  with a total of 55 people reportedly killed, 
including civilians and workers; and one cas e, that of Families Bakery C omp any, where the target was 
the  s olar  p anels  the  bakery  relied  on  for  electricit y.  [31104˚49709]
53
 
During October and November 2023, bakeries were bombed north of Wadi Gaza and in central Gaza. 
This p attern of attacks is consistent with the Israeli military™s order for Palestinians to evacuate from 
the north of Gaza to the s outh.

The bombin g of the al-M aghazi al-Jadeed bakery, the only bakery in al-Maghazi on 24 October 
2023, reportedly claimed the lives of ten civilians.
23
 The attack c reated a crater approximately 13.6 5 
m in diameter and 4.86 m in depth. Based on the size of the c rater, and analysis from Armam ent 
Re search Services, the explosion was likely caused by a 250˝500lb (113˝227 kg) air-delivered 
munition.

The frequency of attacks on bakeries was higher in October, when they were key sites of aid distribution  
in Gaza . Th e combination of direct t argetin g, alon g with sh ortages of ˘o ur an d electricity Œ wh ether due 
to power cuts or the destruction of generators or solar p anels Œ forced many bakeries to shut down.

The home of a family that operated a prominent bakery in Gaza City was hit by an air strike on 1 9

By 25 October, the UN reporte d that 600,000 individuals had taken refuge in 150 UNRWA shelters 
across Gaza.
27
 By 19 November, the reported total was 884,000 in sites which had been identi˚ed by 
the UN as shelters for internally displaced people (IDPs).
28
 
52 percent of internally displaced people, 
the majority of them in UNRWA shelters, relied on humanitarian aid by De c ember.

W hen it declared a supposedly safe ‚humanitarian zone™ in al-Mawasi, the Israeli military reportedly 
proposed a list of approxim ately 150 shelters that it wo uld des ignate as ‚safe™ and not attack.
32
 It refused 
a UN counterproposal to decon˘ict further venues, including festival halls and stadiums.

We understand that shelters that re ceive d displaced civilians are likely to be points of distribution or 
prep aration of aid. Attacks on shelters that we documented involved the direct targeting of a shelter 
building. In the case of the al-Fakhoura school, for example, the bombing of the area around the shelter 
on 14 October, which reportedly killed 34 and injured more than 80, preceded the direct targeting of 
the building on 4 November [3110418492]
 
and 18 November [3111876 530] Œ the latter attack killing a 
total of 50 people Œ following a p attern of persistent and intensifying attacks consistent with attacks 
on hospitals (s ee Chapter 5:"
Destruction of Medical Infrastructure,,").
35
 
61
 
In s ome cas es, facilities within the shelters that were responsible for storing or prep aring food came 
under  direct  ˚re:
62
 
On 4 and 18 November, al-Fakhoura school was struck while actively being us ed as a shelter [31104-
18492 and 3111876530]. Eviden ce, such as images of ovens at th e s ite of bombardment alon gs ide 
bloodied bread, suggests that aid had been stored and prep ared at the shelter during the time of the 
attack (s ee 
Figure  7.7
). A child whos e witness testimony was posted on Instagram described bombs 
strik ing where food preparation and bread-bak ing were taking place.
36
 In a room whic h has been 
pierced through the ceiling by a strike, a repository of grain is als o visible (s ee 
Figure  7.8

63
 
On 11 September, al- Jaouni s chool, which wa s being used as a shelter for displaced p eople by the 
UNRWA, was ‚hit at a time when people were waiting for food™. [ID: 409114360 5]
6 4
 
During the period of ne ar-total sie ge in Octob er, the Israeli military attacked b oth bakeries and 
humanitarian shelters. While four she lters were attacked in October, when attacks on bakeries were 
at the ir high e st, the f requen cy of attacks on sh elters e scalated in November. Durin g this time, repeated  
telecommunications blackouts also frustrated the delivery of aid. The fourth such blackout, bet ween 
16 and 18 N ovember, ‚brought the alrea dy challenging delivery of humanitar ian assistance to an almost  
complete halt™, a ccording to OCHA.
37
 This underscores the importance of aid reserves like those 
provided by shelters during this period.

When the Is ra eli military partially opened the Karem Abu Salem/Ke rem Shalo m crossing o n 17 Dece mbe r,  
aid organisations began to transport aid into Gaza. A n estimated 94 trucks per day entere d Gaza in 
the per iod imm ediate ly following the partial reopening , a signi˜cant inc rease from the previou s period,  
leading to changes in the logistics of aid distribution in Gaza.

After the opening of K arem A bu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing, Palestinian police b egan escorting 
aid convoys to their destinations to ensure their safe arrival.  On 17 and 22 December 2023, the Israeli 
military attacke d Palestinian police while they were escorting aid trucks that had entere d Rafah crossing  
[31217˚3209 5; 3122 2˚792 92]. On 21 De cemb er, the Israeli military attacked the K arem Abu Salem/ 
Kerem Shalom crossing, killing three civilians and the director of the crossing [31221˚ 640 53]. On 26 
December, the Israeli military attacked Palestinian civilian volunteers while they were escorting aid 
trucks that had entered the Rafah crossing [31226˚40242].
68
 
In January 2024, the Israe li military attacked two aid convoys: one in D eir al-Balah Municipality [40115-
86760] and one at the Rafah crossing [40122˚34384]. This conduct ma de aid deliver ies di˛icult or 
impossible even for UN agencies. The World Health Organisation was unable to deliver fuel to al-Shifa 
hospital in the north of Gaza after 22 January. UNRWA was unable to deliver food aid to the north of 
Gaza after 23 January.
41
 The World Food Programme paused food deli verie s for week s in Feb ruary 
becaus e of ‚a strike on a UNRWA truck and [...] the abs ence of a functioning humanitarian noti˜cation 
system™.
42
 According to information shared with Forensic Arc hitecture by UNRWA, on 5 February, 
Israeli naval ˜re directly struck an UNRWA food convoy while trucks were ‚ waiting at an agreed holding  
position prior to crossing the IDF checkpoint on the coastal road™ [4020 5˚93035].

On 6 Fe bruary, the Is raeli militar y attacked a po lice c ar esc o rting an aid c o nvoy, killing six po lice 
o˛icers [40206˚84308]. The Israeli military later dropped ˝yers with a photo of the destroyed police 
car, with the statement: ‚Our message is clear: the Israeli s ecurit y s ervices will not allow the s ecurit y 
ap paratuses of Hamas to c o ntinue wo r king.™
43
 The Is raeli mili tar y also kill ed three p o lice o˛ice r s

R eportedly, these at tacks convinced police it was too dangerous to continue escorting convoys or 
guarding trucks, creating a vacuum in security that saw trucks and drivers attacked in the holding 
areas near crossings.
45
 Subsequently, the World Food Programm e attempted to resum e its operations,  
but had to suspend them once again on 20 February, citing ‚complete chaos and violence due to the

In late February, the United States administration reportedly asked Israe l to stop targeting members 
of the civilian p olice force es corting aid trucks in Gaza, warning that a ‚total breakdown of law and 
order™ was signi˜cantly exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.
48
 Nonetheless, Israeli attacks on key 
aid pers onnel continued, including a strike on a UNRWA-run food aid distribution centre clos e to the 
border with Egypt on 13 Marc h 2024, which resulted in the deaths of six people, including Muhammad  
A bu Hasna, deput y head of police operations in Rafah, and a UNRWA aid worker, Hosni Yous ef A bu 
Jaz ar [40313˚42803]. 22 othe rs were injured in the attack .
49
 Philippe Lazz arini, UNRWA co mmissione r-
g eneral, said that the co ordinates of the aid ce ntre ha d been s hared w ith the Isra eli mili tary re peatedly.

The Israeli military als o struck a car on 13 Marc h in Khirbat al-Adas, killing Nidal Musa Sheikh al-Eid 
and Muhammad Ibrahim A bu Hass oun, an aid worker. 
51
 [ 40313˚ 68743]
73
 
The timing and distribution of the Israeli military™s attacks on civilian police forces coordinating aid, as 
well as aid convoys, suggests that Israel targeted them when they were most relied on for delivering 
relief, in e˛ect preventing international organisations and UN agencies from delivering aid by creating 
a demonstrable risk of their workers being killed by the Israeli military.

JanuaryŒMarch 2024: Attacks on civilians seeking aid
74
 
Civilian s were targe ted when they gathered to receive aid in proximity to the Ne tzarim corridor

t rucks are repres ented as brown lines wit h arrows indicat ing t he direct ion of movement t hrough crossings. During t his period, 
t he nort hernmost Erez crossings were not oper at ional, and all aid t rucks could move in on ly th rough t he s out hern crossings, 
where imports were rest ricted. The Netzarim corridor is repres ented as a dashed line wit h t hree checkpo ints on it (from west 
to east: al-Rashid Ro ad checkpo int, Salah al-Din Ro ad checkpo int, and Gate 9 6 crossing).  Note t hat t his date r ange focus es 
on attacks on civi lians s eeking aid speci˚cally at t he Netzarim corridor Œ ot her attacks of t his type occurred outside t he date 
range indicated here.
746
75
 
By February, Israeli at tacks on police involved in aid coordination led to a vacuum in aid logistics in Gaza.  
This wa s particular ly important in the sou th of Gaz a, which had the only borde r crossing where aid 
was permitted to p ass into Gaza. A id trucks would enter in the s outh and then move north to deliver it.
76
 
The Netzarim corridor, which by this time divided Gaza into a nor th and a south, played a signi˚cant role  
in limiting aid crossing into northern Gaza. A ll other crossings leading into the north from Israel were 
closed from 7 October 2023 until 1 May 2024, so the only way that aid could reach there was by travelling  
from the so uth. (O n 5 April, in response to a request for more aid by the US administration, Israel 
promised that the northern Erez cro ssing would open on 7 April, but that de cision was later rescinded.)
52
77
 
The Netz arim c or rid or (the ou tlines of which began to ap p ear o n satelli te image ry as early as 15 
November) inters ects with the ‚safe routes™ that the Israeli military designate d for the evacuation of 
displaced people who were ordered or forced to move s outh: Salah al-Din Road and al-Rashid Road. 
The ˚rst checkpoint processed Palestinians travelling so uthwards on foot.
53
 However, as aid trucks 
began to arrive in G aza, satellite imagery showed additional checkpoints appeared on the Israeli-
impos ed internal border, halting aid trucks from the s outh of Gaza.
54
78
 
A id trucks that managed to travers e the con˘ict area in the s outh now faced signi˚cant delays at the 
Netzarim corridor checkpoints.
55
 Thus, even while COGAT issued reports that it was allowing more aid  
through the  
external
 border crossings into Gaza, this new 
internal 
border inhibited the delivery of aid.
79
 
The restriction on aid deliveries to northern Gaza, made worse by the closing of the northern crossings,  
the imposition of  the  Netzarim corridor,  and  the  targeting  of  aid  infrastructure  forced many  Palestinians  
to migrate s outh. 
80
 
In testimony provide d to Forensic Archite cture by a Palestinian rights group, a civilian who was di splace d  
from the Tu˜ah neighbourhood in northern Gaza in D ecember 2023 explained that even when he was 
informed that he could return to Tu˜ah, food in northern Gaza was too scarce for his family to survive. 
‚We did not ˚nd food becaus e it was prevented from reac hing northern Gaza,™ he said. ‚We started 
eating barley, wheat, and s oybeans, the food of cows, and becaus e of the di˜icult y of converting and

A former resident of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza also cited the di˜iculty of obtaining food due to 
scarcit y and food prices as a reas on to leave his home. ‚At the beginning of February 2024, the prices 
of food b egan to ri s e signi˚cantl y due to the unavailability of most of them in the market,™ he said. ‚A kilo  
of ˘our reached (180) shekels, a kilo of barley (100), and a kilo of corn (130), and things became very 
di˜icult for us, and due to the lack of cash, and many c itizen s do not have a ˚xed s ource of income, s o 

the circumstances became complicated, and hunger began to appear among us, and many children 

were transferred to hospitals due to malnutrition .™ Faced with thes e di˜iculties, this man als o decided 
to leave his home. ‚D ue to my inability to provide food, my daughters were unable to manage without ... 
food and bread. A nd s o, becaus e of the famine, I decided to move to the s outh, speci˚call y to Rafah, 

where my family had previously been displaced.™
57
82
 
Not all residents of northern Gaza left for the s outh, however, and thos e that remained su˜ered dire 
conditions which were exacerbated by restrictions on aid pa ssing through the Net zarim corridor. 
O
ur data shows that bet ween January and March 2024, civilians seeking aid in northern Gaza were 
attacked by the Israeli military 37 times at al-Kuwaiti and al-Nabulsi roundabouts, which are just north 
of the che ckpoints where the two ‚safe routes™ cross the Netzarim corridor. The majority of these 
attacks occurred after the ICJ™s ˚rst Provisional Measures Order on 26 January 2024.

In an interview con ducted by the Bisan Center, a Palestinian research gro up, one Palestinian ˚eld 
coordinator for aid convoys explaine d: ‚After the occup ation s earches the trucks, it orders us to p ass 
through al-Rashid Road or Salah al- Din Road without prior warning, and because the occupation 
destroys thes e streets every day, whether by bulldozers or by building sand mounds or by throwing 
missiles and large bombs in the middle of thes e streets, we can only cross a few metres at al-Nabulsi 
roundabout or al-Kuwait roundabout. They als o target all thos e who attempt to rep air thos e streets. 
I stop either at al- Nabulsi roundab out, the 17th roundab out, or al- Kuwait roundab out, but there i s 
no coordinating point to receive this aid. The dangero us thing about the matter is that the drones 
[quadcopters] and tanks of the occupation advance while we c ross those areas and shoot at the 
people gathered to receive aid, often killing dozens and wounding dozens more.™
59
84
 
According to the interview, the ˚e ld coordinator also cited an incident where the Isra e li military 
intercepted three aid truck driver s and ordered them to traver se the al-Rashid checkpoint at high 
speed under the threat of being bombed. This reportedly forced the drivers to run over people who 
could not get out of the way.
60
85
 
The Netzarim corridor provides the Israeli military with immediate control over aid logistics, which it 
lacks els ewhere in Gaza. On 22 February, in the wake of the breakdown of aid operations caus ed by 
attacks on  police  o˜icers, Israeli  o˜icials  announced  their  plan  for  ‚humanitarian pockets™,  which  they  
described as areas secured by the Israeli military, in which cooperative Palestinian partners wo uld 
oversee aid deliver ies. They suggested the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City as a candidate for 
trialling the idea .
61
 Israeli so urces have so far not publicly described any areas in Gaza as o˜ icially 
co nstitu ting a ‚humanitarian pocket™. However, attacks o n Palestinian organis ations facili tating aid 
near the N etzar im corr idor (see next Section) and third-party reports
62
 
both suggest this idea was 
implemented in aid distribution ne ar the Netzarim corridor throughout January and March 2024 , 
whereby aid distribution was overs een and moderated by the Israeli military.
86
 
This form of aid distribution is als o re˘ected in Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant™s stated plan for 
Gaza: ‚We will is olate areas, remove Hamas operatives from thes e areas and introduce forces that will 
enable an alternative government to form Œ an alternative that threatens Hamas.™ Israe l™s approac h 
to such an alternative government is doc umented con cretely in its day-after plans, which envision 
collaboration with cooperative Palestinian civic organisations .
63
 Accordingly, Israel solicited Palestinian 
gro ups to cooperate in aid facilitation. For example, the aid convoy that precip itated the Flour M assacre

wa s rep o rtedly o rganised by Israeli o˜icials a s part of a plan to co ordinate aid d eliveries with loc al 
businessmen in Gaza without the help of international aid groups.
64
 Groups that refus e to cooperate 
have been targeted by the Israeli military (as discuss ed in the next subs ection). 
87
 
It is notable that while the Israeli military attacked police in the south of Gaza, compromising aid 
logistics there, it s olidi˚ed its control over the movement of aid into the north. On 12 March, the Israeli 
military announced a new crossing, Gate 96 , on the eastern end of the Netzarim corridor, ‚as p art of a 
pilot to prevent Hamas from taking over the aid ™.
65
 On 12 March, C OGAT posted online: ‚UN orgs, you 
too should send aid trucks to the north, we will coordinate as usual. T here is no limit to the amount 
and movement of aid to northern Gaza.™
66
 This statement elides the conditions on the ground created 
by the Israeli military and the Netzarim corridor, which resulted in the killing of hundreds of civilians 
s eeking aid and endangering the lives of aid truck drivers. The e˜iciency of the Gate 96 crossing was 
reportedly minimal in contrast to the normal throughput of the s outhern Gaza crossings.
67
88
 
The Netzarim corridor als o hous ed the temporary ˘oating pier, built by the Israeli military™s ally the US 
military, as an alternative mean s of supplying aid to Palestinians in north Gaza. However, the fact that 
the pier (which wa s re moved in July) was ins talled in an Is raeli mili tary zo ne made aid wor ker s reluc tant  
to c oop erate with delive ries originating there. According to a doc tor wo rking w ith an International 
Medical Corps mission in Gaza, aid workers began to avoid the area when Israeli helicopters were 
seen taking o˜ from near the ˘oating US p ier in June, during a hostage rescue miss ion in which 
hundre ds of Palestinian s were kille d.
68
 Thi s sighting of the Israeli military ne arby the US pier raise d 
concerns that the location of the p ier in the Netzarim corridor meant that it could be used not only 
for aid administration but als o for military logistics. 
89
 
T his dual use of the Netzarim corridor for aid and military logistics contextualises the attacks on civilians  
se eking aid there. The Israeli decision to conc entrate these logistics in one place, in an apparent 
e˜ort to control aid facilitation more thoroughly, has had lethal consequences for civilians reliant 
on this inf rastructure for critical aid. It also undermined the notion that the US pier could e˜ecti vely 
operate to administer aid to northern Gaza. Rather than optimising the administration of aid as such, 
the Netzarim corridor, the pier, and the checkpoints compris e one logistical complex for intercepting 
aid and repla cing humanitar ian aid de livery systems with systems controlled by the Isra eli military 
an d th e US. Palestinian e˜ort s to develop alternative aid systems are n ot only forbidden within this 
infrastructure but are directly attacked (see next subsection).

with a high level of organisation, while Israeli control over aid exchanges near the Netzarim corridor 
had repeatedly resulted in mass casualties. Together with the e˜orts by Palestinian Security Forces 
to divert aid receipt away from the Net zarim corridor, these successful aid deliveries demonstrate 
that there were competing re gimes of aid admini stration. Thi s helps to contex tuali se s ubse quent

to 25 J une 2024. 
759
100
 
Our analysis suggests that attacks on aspects of aid infrastructure in Gaza began very s oon after 
the commencement of Israel™s military campaign in October 2023. The Rafah crossing was attacked 
during three distinct periods. The repeated attacks on the Rafah crossing are signi˜cant, becaus e up 
until the last attack, the crossing was operated by Egypt.
82
 While the other c rossings could be clos ed 
by Israel, the Rafah crossing was more di˚icult to control due to Egyptian juris diction.
101
 
B et ween 9 and 16 October 2023, the Rafah crossing was struck at least three times.
83
 On the other 
hand, othe r ear ly attacks o n aid infras tru cture we re co nce ntrated no rth of Wadi Gaza, w hich c oincid ed  
with Israeli evacuation orders directing civilians in the north to move s outh.
84
 After the Rafah crossing 
was reopened on 21 October, attacks on aid infrastructure were s een in the s outh as well. 
85
102
 
On 21 December, days after Israel opened the K arem A bu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing, the Israeli 
military attacked the crossing, killing its director. [ID: 31221˛ 640 53]
103
 
After A pril 2024, when aid intake was at its highest, attacks on aid infrastructure shifted primarily to 
the south, along with the Israeli invasion of Rafah.
86
 These attacks included:
(a)
 
On 
6 May
, th e I sraeli milit ary set ˜re to an aid wareh o use n ear th e Rafah cros sin g. [ID: 
40507˛24645] The Isra eli military seized the Rafah c rossing , which was operated by Egypt 
up  until  this  point.
87
(b)
 
On 
7˜8 May
, th e I sraeli milit ary att acked th e Rafah East Distrib ution Centre operated by 
UN RWA.  [ID:  40 507˛83806]
(c)
 
On 
3 June
, the Isra eli military attac ked the Rafah logistics base operated by UNRWA. 
[ID: 40603˛06 535]
(d )
 
On 
12 Jun e
, the Israeli military destroyed a Humanity & Inclusion U.S. warehouse managed 
by  Atlas  Logistique  in  Rafah.  [ID:  40612˛74960]
104
 
From the invasion of Rafah on 7 May until 20 May, ‚not a single WFP truck cross ed from the s outhern 
corridors from Egypt,™ according to the World Food Programme director for the Palestinian territories. 
WFP also lost access to its main warehouse in so uthern Gaza, because it was included within an 
evacuation zone.

Testimonies provided by aid workers suggest that the administrative and logistical processes put in 
place by Israel for aid deliveries in fact delay or prevent thos e deliveries. According to a UNICEF sta˜ 
member, even w he n aid ente r s throu gh a crossing into Gaza, aid organisatio ns may s till be de nied 
access to it.
89
 They als o state that Israeli decisions to reroute aid convoys moving through Gaza tend 
to slow d ow n these aid c o nvoys and place the m in dang e r mo re of te n than they protec t the m fro m 
con˘ict . 
According to a member of th e United Nations OCHA st a˜, crossin gs may clo se an d open 
arbitraril y without providing any rationale.
90
 
They state that while Israel depends on humanitarian 
organisations to explicitly indicate what is required to administer aid, at the same time it attacks and 
impedes thes e very organisations.
106
 
Critically, delays to aid convoys do not simply slow down aid deliveries but prevent them from being 
facilitated altogether. For example, the same UNICEF sta˜ member cited a situation where a mission 
to deliver clean water to K amal Adwan Hospital was granted ˚ve hours initially, but was then asked to 
complete its task in just 45 minutes, leading to the mission being entirely abandoned.
91
 Other examples 
of similar circumstances have been reported.
92
107
 
A nother aid worker described the harm of the delays and detours: ‚I su˜ered from s evere p anic and 
an xiety for many days following th e shocking event s on th e night of 17 January 2024. We were t argeted  
while transportin g an d unloadin g food and ˘our to th e n orthern Gaza Strip, wh ere th e occupation army  
had forced us to circle around the outskirts of the central Gaza Strip near Juhr al-Deek, a distance of 
32 kilometres, to reach the Kuwait roundabout near Gaza Cit y, which delayed the delivery of this aid, 
mainly because of running out of fuel, which left these trucks exp osed to looting by local armed groups.™

The successful aid deliveries in late Marc h (outlined in Section H5: Attacks on aid pers onnel Œ aid

described as the ‚golden age™ of aid reaching the north of Gaza, at which point even vegetables could 
be found there.

 Even as the Israeli military forced Palestinian organisations administering aid in the 
north during this period to stop working, some food remained available at market

May 2024: Israeli vigilante at tacks on aid convoys an d drivers
112
 
We documented six instances of Israeli vigilantes at tacking aid convoys travelling to Gaza through 
Israel or the occupied West Bank beginning on 1 May 2024, where in four cas es Israeli s oldiers were 
pres ent but did not prevent the vigilantes from assaulting aid convoys, and in t wo cas es the drivers 
were assaulted.
1 13
 
Blockades of aid convoys by Israeli civilians were documented as early as January 2024.
99
 However,  
v iol ent atta cks on aid c onvoys by Is raeli p rotesters e rupted in May 2024, and were not stop ped by 
Israeli soldiers who were present.
100
1 14
 
These attacks followed months of disruptions and demonstrations by Israeli protesters against allowing 
any aid into Gaza. Vigilante groups, notably Tsav 9, formed and gradually m ounted bloc kades in 
collaboration with other Israe li  civilian organisations, suc h as Mothers of IDF Soldiers.
101
 The blockades 
were reportedly organis ed on s ocial media
102
 and via WhatsA pp, where the locations of incoming aid 
convoys were shared.
103
 
104
1 15
 
The ˚rst aid convoys to Gaza were bloc ked by Israe li protesters on 18 January 2024. At ˚rst, the 
protes ter s set up enc ampments to blo ck the Karem Abu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing, then the 
Nitzana crossing.
105
 On 24 January 2024, protesters blocked 51 out of 60 trucks attempting to enter 
through the Karem A bu Salem/Kerem Shalom c rossing. 
1 16
 
On 28 January, Major General Yaron Finke lman, hea d of the Isra eli military™s Southern Command, 
announced an expanded military zone to prevent protesters from intercepting aid. Police arrested 
1 3 protesters
106
 and suppressed a crowd of 3 0 0.
107
 From May onward s, video evidence emerged 
showing Israeli s oldiers assigned to escort aid convoys to Gaza standing by while vigilantes blocked, 
vandalised, and destroyed aid and at tacked truck drivers.
108

PAT TERN FINDINGS
1˜
The Israeli military targeted aid sites an d systems of aid distribution when an d where they became 
the main mode of aid facilitation. We observed that this targeting followed a pat tern of overlapping 
ph ases, during which attacks on the speci˛ed aid categories intensi˛ed.

In October 2023, as our databas e and timeline above demonstrate, bakeries were targeted when they 
played a critical role in aid distribution at the beginning of the Israeli military camp aign. The attacks 
on bakerie s corresponded to high volume s of people having be en se en queuing outside of them. 
Bakeries in the north of G aza were targete d ˚rst, and in Deir al-Balah, further south, s ubs e quentl y. 
Following this destruction, all bakeries in the northern governates of Gaza were no longer operational. 
By 27 November, the ˚ve mills in Gaza were no longer operating due to fuel shortages.
121
 The last of 
thes e mills was directly bombed by the Israeli military on 15 November.
122
 Access to food in the north 
of Gaza was severely restricted.
 
130
 
In November, as our databas e and timeline above demonstrate, shelters were targeted as they began 
to play a central role in housing people displaced by Israe li attacks, as well as in the receipt and 
prep aration of aid following the destruction of bakeries. The highest concentration of atta c ks on she lters  
was during this month. Facilities for storage and prep aration of food at the shelters came under ˚re. 
Te lecommunications blac kouts impeded the delivery of aid, bringing it to a near halt in mid-November.
123
131
 
Police were targeted when they played a c ritical role in escorting aid convoys following the opening of 
the K arem A bu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing. Attacks targeted o˜icers in their cars while they were 
e scor ting aid convoys or en route to facilit ate aid, as our timeline sh ows. This targeting prompted a 
breakdown of aid administration that compelled international humanitarian organisations to suspend 
their operations. Thes e attacks on police happened while Israel was cons olidating its control over the 
p assage  and  administration  of  aid  through the  Netzarim  corridor.
132
 
Civilians were attac ked when Israe l assumed control over aid exc hanges by building the Netzarim 
corridor and the two chec k points through it on al-Rashid and Salah al-Din Roads (see Chapter 2: 
Sp atial C ontrol). The corridor ™s role in sieving aid is consistent with the stated aims of Israeli o˜icials 
to establish ‚humanitarian pockets™ that would be amenable to Israe li control. The points at which the 
Israeli- designated ‚safe routes™ met areas of Israeli control became the most lethal places for civilians 
s eeking aid in Gaza.
133
 
A id administrators, such as the s enior police o˜icial Faiq al-Mabhouh, who led the civil administration 
for crisis management, an d politically powerful familie s, who played a key role in escor tin g an d receivin g  
aid truc ks, were k illed when they began to play prominent roles in aid distribution and o˜er alternatives  
to frequently att acked Israeli aid administration at th e Netzarim corridor (see 
Figure 7.24
, lin e 5, ‚Civilians  
s eeking aid  near  Netzarim  corridor  ...™).
13 4
 
Israe li vigilante protests and blockades on aid convoys were not confronted e˜ective ly and were 
reportedly supported in s ome cas es by Israeli s oldiers, as our analysis address es (s ee Section H8: 
Israe li vigilante attac ks on aid convoys and drivers). We documented six attac ks on aid convoys by 
Israeli vigilantes, involving t wo instances of violent attacks on aid delivery workers.
135
 
Overall, attacks on eac h of these facilities were extensive and s evere enough to compromis e their 
operations, force them out of operation, or compel organisations to issue statements that they could 
no longer continue their aid operations, even after they had publicly declared their intent to operate 
as aid facilitators.

2˜
The periods af ter which Israel increased the ˜ow of hum anitarian aid into Gaza (late December 
2023; late March an d early April 2024; early May 2024) coincide in time an d space with an increase 
of Israel™s targeting of the means of distributing th at aid, including the logistics, personnel, an d 
infrastructure necessary. 
136
 
When Israel opened the K arem A bu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing on 17 December, for the ˚rst time 
since 7 O ctober, following pressure from the US , a higher volume of aid trucks began to enter Gaza. 
124
 Days later, on 21 December, the Israeli military attacked the Karem Abu Salem/Kerem S halom 
crossing, killing the dire ctor of the Karem Abu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing. Also, in the s ub se quent  
months of January and Feb ruary, the Israeli military attacked aid personnel, which forced humanitarian  
organisations to suspend their operations, citing the danger of operating in Gaza. 
137
 
In late March and e arly April, par tic ularly following international pre s sure in re sponse to the de adly 
Israeli attack on the World C entral Kitchen convoy, Israel shifted its policy to permit higher volumes 
of trucks to enter Gaza. More food diversit y was s een for the ˚rst time in northern Gaza, and 9 A pril 
2024 saw the highest number of trucks enter G aza since 7 Octob er 2023. In the week after, we 
documented signi˚cant attacks on markets, at a time when they were distributing food and civilians 
were heavily depending on them.
138
 
On 6 May 2024 , three days after incoming aid re ached an all-time high sinc e the beginning of the 
invasion Œ 340 trucks in one day Œ the Israeli military invaded Rafah, s eized the Egyptian- controlled 
Rafah crossing, bringing the number of incoming aid trucks to an all-time low.
139
 
On 13 May, in response to international pressure, the Isra eli military opened chec kpoints for aid trucks 
at the Jordanian border. The ˚rst inbound trucks, crossing from Jordan into the occupied West Bank, 
were escorted by the Isra eli military, which failed to p revent vigilantes fro m c ommitting vio lent atta cks 
on aid trucks and drivers. 
140
 
Overall, aid workers at humanitarian organisations cite the di˜icult y of getting aid to civilians in Gaza 
during Israel™s ongoing military camp aign, even after it is allowed through a crossing from Israel.

The"
Destruction of Medical Infrastructure,,targeting of aid
Destruction of Medical Infrastructure,,"occurred in tan dem with Israeli military™s evacuation orders an d coincides 
with its at tempts to force Palestinian civilians to displace from the nor th of Gaza. 
 
The construction of the new intern al border in the Netzarim corridor an d the checkpoints within it 
suppor ting a one-way (north to south) movement of civilians coincided with the restriction of aid as a 
means of"
Destruction of Medical Infrastructure,,displacement
Destruction of Medical Infrastructure,,".
141
 
Shif ting aid to the south:
 Attacks on bakeries were predominantly in the north of Gaza and followed 
Israeli evacuation orders instructing all Palestinians to move s outh. A s the bakeries were eliminated, 
the necessity for civilians to move south was enhanced. Israel also opened the southern crossings 
for aid while keeping the northern Erez cross ing closed, which increased the relative availability of 
aid in the south comp ared to the north.
142
 
R estricting aid in the ‚north™:
 As aid came into the s outh, the Israeli military attacked police escorting 
aid convoys to the north. Israeli attacks on aid convoys made the transportation of aid through Gaza 
more dangerous. During the same period, Israel e stab lishe d the Netzarim corridor (se e Chapter 2:"
Spatial Control,,"), w hich delayed trucks m oving north from the sou ther n crossings, aggravating the 
lack of aid in the north. Famil y organi sation s that attempted to fac ilitate the distribution of aid north 
of this border were attacked at the same time.
143
 
Impairing aid in the south:
 In the ˚rst eight months of the camp aign, Rafah was the main destination 
for displaced Palestinian civilians. With the 6 May 2024 invasion of Rafah, the Israe li military restricted 
access to aid coming from the southern crossings by seizing the Rafah crossing and attacking aid 
infra s tru c ture. It was also at that time that attacks by v igilantes o n aid c o nvoys moving throu gh the 
Israeli- occupied West Bank and Israel occurred despite the presence of Israeli soldiers.
144
 
Notably, the al-Mawasi ‚humanitarian zone™ has no direct access to aid crossings, making aid supply 
reliant on Israeli control. With the o˜ensive in R afah starting on 6 May 2024, aid to this zone was restricted.
145
 
This analysis challenges Israeli claims about their e˜orts to facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid 
to civilians in Gaza, such as thos e posted frequently on C OGAT™s X/ Twitter account.
125
 While C OGAT 
has reported on the quantit y of aid trucks permitted to enter Gaza™s external crossings and criticis ed 
humanitarian organisations for failing to distribute aid that has entered Gaza, this p artial view focus es 
only on the most super˚cial aspects of aid administration, distorting the realit y of aid logistics within 
Gaza, which the Israeli military has compromis ed on all fronts.
126
 A n additional problem with C OGAT™s 
count of trucks allowed into Gaza is that , a ccording to a spokesperson for UN OCHA, the Isra eli military  
insists that trucks of aid pres ented for inspection at the crossings are often half full.

B y layering data derived from the di˜erent categories of acts, analysed in the chapters of this report, we  
documented repe ated relation s that recur in time and spac e, demon strating their
 wide and interrelate d  
p a tterns.  
(1)
We determine that the harm caused by di˜erent types of acts was aggravated when performed
in concert and in relation to others, resulting in a cumulative harm.
(2 )
The patterns suggest that the re lation between the observed acts is not haphazard or random.
(3)
The compounde d destruction documente d on the ground, brought ab out by the Israeli military  
camp aign, has been organis ed and designed.

O ur anal ysi s of the relation b etween the cate gories of Israeli military conduct as well as the natural 
characteristics  of  the  landscape  indicates  the  following:  
(1)
The elements of"
Spatial Control,,spatial control
Spatial Control,,", the bu˜er zone, raid routes, and corridors (s e e Chapter
2: Spatial Contro l) were u tilised in tandem wi th the Israeli military™s evacuation orders to
concentrate civilians in p arts of Gaza. The Netzarim corridor became an unp assable border,
wi th checkpoints that d enied the retur n of civilians who we re disp laced to the sou th back into
the north and restricted the amount of aid coming into the north (s ee Chapters 2, 7: Sp atial
C ontrol,  Targeting  of  A id,  
Figure  
 
8.7
, and 
Figure  
 
8.8
).
(2 )
When layering the p atterns of"
Spatial Control,,displacement
Spatial Control,,and those of the construction of the system of
Spatial Control,,spatial control
Spatial Control,,", outlined in point 1 above, further with the"
Spatial Control,,targeting of aid
Spatial Control,,", particularly in the
n orth, we n otic ed that attacks on ci vilians seekin g aid were more con centrated in proximity to
the Netzarim corridor. This element of sp atial control created a division that put the delivery
of aid, and civilians seeking aid, at risk. Acts of"
Spatial Control,,displacement
Spatial Control,,", segregation, and targeting
co mbined to ag gravate the co nditions of life (see Chapte r 7: Targ eting of Aid, 
Figure 
 
8.11
,
and  
Figure  
 
8.12
).
786
(3)
 
When we layered the above p atterns, outlined in 1 and 2, with the extent of urban destruction, 
including the"
Spatial Control,,destruction of civilian infrastructure
Spatial Control,,", we could determine that areas from which 
most Palestinian c ivilian s were displace d in the north deprive d those that remaine d there from  
ess ential means to maintain life and put them at an ongoing risk or forced their"
Spatial Control,,displacement
Spatial Control,,to the s outh (s ee Chapter 3:
Displacement,,", Chapter 5:"
Destruction of Medical Infrastructure,,", 
Figure   8.4
, and 
Figure   8.28
).
(4)
 
The direct destruction of roads in thes e urban centres, due to direct bombing or the creation 
of rubble from destroyed buildings on the roads, made the us e of vehicles to evacuate along 
approved ro utes more di˜icult. Pedestrian movement was a more precarious means of 
movement unde r ˚re. We have o bse rved a re p eated patte rn of targ eting ‚s afe rou tes™ af ter 
th ey have been de signated as such by the Israeli military (see Chapter 6: De struction of Civilian  
Infrastructure and 
Figure  
 
8.25
).
(5)
 
When we layered the evacuation orders received by Palestinian civilians with the destruction 
of agriculture, we observed another corre lation: the a gricultural parts in the east parts of 
Gaz a received evacuatio n o rd er s and the ˚el d s there we re subsequ ently and tho roughly 
destroyed. The elements of sp atial control were then constructed over the areas from whic h 
civilians were displaced, suggesting"
Destruction of Medical Infrastructure,,displacement
Destruction of Medical Infrastructure,,"and the destruction of agriculture were an 
organis ed result of the plan to construct the e lements of sp atial control (s ee Chapters 2, 3,

Overlaying the elements of"
Displacement,,spatial control
Displacement,,"with ‚evacuation arrows™ (see section A (Glossary) in  
Chapter 3: D is placeme nt) found in the Is raeli mili tar y™s evacuation o rd e rs, we c oul d d eter mine  
that displaced Pal estinian civilians were channelled through checkp oints f unc tio ning a s 
control points. This correlation suggested to us that one of the aims of"
Displacement,,displacement

enable the military to surveil Palestinian civilians, in cluding reportedly us in g biometric dat a 
c oll ectio n and checks exercised v ia facial rec ogni tion sof tware (see Chapter s 2, 3: Spatial

Th e destr uction of agriculture in Gaza an d th e t argeting of aid aggravated each other an d 
produce d food scarcity and famine. Studying the  destruction  of agriculture in relation  to 
the"
Displacement,,targeting of aid
Displacement,,", reveals another compounded e˜ect : the destruction of agr iculture Œ 
˚elds, orchards, greenhous es Œ restricted the possibilit y for Palestinians in Gaza to grow and 
obtain food independently, and the"
Displacement,,targeting of aid
Displacement,,"restricted and controlled food coming 
from the outside. With food s ources inside Gaza destroyed, food could only arrive though 
Israeli checkpoints, where its distribution was controlled and restricted by the Israeli military. 
Food distribution infrastructure was directly t argeted, limitin g the amount of aid available 
for Pale stinian ci vilians (see Chapters 2, 3, 4:"

created two zones: t he nort h above t he Netzarim corridor, and t he al-Mawasi ‚humanitarian zone™, which occupies s ome of t he area  
s out h of it. Prior to October 2023, t he nort h, including Ga za City, was the cultur al, pol it ical, and business cent re of Ga za. 1.1 million of  
its inhabitants received evacuation order s and the area was largely destroyed (s ee Chapter 6:"
Destruction of Civilian Infrastructure,,"™).  
The populati on that remained lives in da mag ed homes o r in publi c buildings ac ting as shel ters . Aid is r es tri c ted by the two checkpoin ts  
along t he Netzarim corridor (see Chapter 7: Targeting of A id). P rior to October 2023, al-Mawasi, in the southwest (l abelled ‚south  
enclave™), was an underdeveloped area of dunes and small-scale cultivation. Since October 2023, it has been increasingly overcrowded  
wit h tents and ot her tempor ary st ructures t hat do not provide su˜icient shelter from t he weat her and o˜er no privacy. The two areas  
have a one-way link between t hem - from t he nort h, s out h towards al-Mawasi - but not in t he opposite direct ion.

nort h, agriculture has been almost completely dest royed and most attacks on aid are recorded. The systemat ic dest ruct ion of

This re po rt id e nti˚ed ‚patter ns™ w i thin these acts of v io le nce, by w hich we mean the re peti tion of same,  
similar or related acts, at di˜erent times and places. 
4
 
Such p atterns indicated to us that thes e attacks are organis ed and designed rather than occurring at 
random or in a haphazard way. 
5
 
T he interface of the GCD allowed our researchers to delineate a geographic region (within Gaza), a 
time period, or both, and retrieve information about all incidents we collected within that delineated 
domain . In this way, the GCD provided our res earc hers with the raw data with whic h to analys e potential  
relations and patterns bet ween incidents. 
6
 
The GC D was also conc ei ved as b oth a tool of pre sentation and allowe d us to extract and present 
di˜erent maps. 
7
 
The e˜ect of military act s on the ci vilian population in Gaza was reve aled by stud y ing the simult aneous,  
or proximate, application of di˜erent t ypes of acts in the same territory. We established the existence 
of relations bet ween incidents of more than one category. 
8
 
We found that military actions are multifaceted and that relations bet ween di˜erent t ypes of actions 
exist. The se, we establishe d, generated c umulative and compounded harm, with the conse quenc e 
of each act aggravating those of others. 
9
 
The establishment of p atterns out of a large multiplicit y of individual acts allowed us to determine the 
extent to which the level of death and destruction in˘icted across Gaza was organis ed.

Biden, will result in pushing the civilian population to the south of the Gaza Strip and will make 
it possible to tighten the general siege on Gaza in the areas of electr icity, water, and fue l,

The brea dth of governm ent ˚gures whose statem ents directly speak to the cutting of essential need s, 
including humanitarian aid, food, water, electricity, and fuel suggests that the disruption of aid and 
ess ential s ervices was a governmental and military policy.
10
 
Our ˚ndings on the p atterns of the Israeli military™s conduct in Gaza with regards to the targeting of 
aid  are  outlined  in  
Chapter 7:"
Targeting of Aid,,".
 They include attacks on bakeries, civilian shelters, aid 
pers onnel,  aid  convoys, aid  distribution  and  storage  sites,  and  civilian s accessing  aid.
